But the **greasy**(油腻的) substance actually creates a barrier that prevents heat from escaping.

但这种油腻的物质实际上会形成屏障，阻止热量散发。

This can cause the burn to deepen, damaging even more layers of the skin.

这可能会导致烧伤加深，损害更多的皮肤层。

Using ice can freeze the tissue and constrict blood vessels.

使用冰块可能会冻伤组织并使血管收缩。

The extreme cold can reduce blood flow to the wound and slow the healing process.

极端的寒冷会减少伤口的血流量并减缓愈合过程。

Which is why you should just stick to cool running water.

### [How A Flintlock Grenade Launcher Works 😮](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1O3Xs1faCUA)

They load a grenade into the barrel of the launcher.

他们将手榴弹装入发射器的枪管中。

Gunpowder was previously poured into the **firing pan**(火药池), and the hammer was **secured**(固定) with **flint**(燧石).

事先将火药倒入击发盘中，并用燧石固定击锤。

When the trigger is pulled, the flint strikes the steel, creating sparks.

当扳机被扣下时，燧石撞击钢铁，产生火花。

These sparks ignite the gunpowder in the pan, sending a flame through the touch hole into the **main charge**.

火花点燃击发盘内的火药，火焰通过火孔进入主装药。

The burning ignites the powder behind the grenade, propelling it out of the barrel.

燃烧点燃榴弹后方的火药，将其推出枪管。

As the grenade flies, a timed fuse burns, allowing it to explode after reaching the target.

当手榴弹飞行时，定时引信燃烧，使其在到达目标后爆炸。

### [How Kangaroos Drown Dogs 😱](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7K9mTbmcfp4)

If a kangaroo is being chased by a dog, it might jump into a river.

The dog, following the chase, will usually swim after it.

追赶的狗通常会游过去。

As the dog swims closer, the kangaroo grabs it with its powerful arms and sharp claws.

当狗游得更近时，袋鼠会用强有力的手臂和锋利的爪子抓住它。

Next, it pushes the dog's head underwater and holds it there, trying to drown it.

接着，它将狗的头按进水里并压住，试图把它淹死。

With its strong claws, the kangaroo grips tight, using its weight to keep the dog submerged until it stops moving.

袋鼠用强壮的爪子紧紧抓住，并用自己的体重把狗压在水下，直到它停止挣扎。

### [How Tattoo Guns Work 🤔](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QOwWyJyaLzc)

When a tattoo gun enters your skin, a needle rapidly punctures the surface, creating tiny wounds.

当纹身机刺入皮肤时，针头会快速穿刺表面，造成微小的伤口。

This needle moves up and down at high speeds, driven by an electric motor.

这根针由电动机驱动，以极高的速度上下移动。

It draws ink from a reservoir.

它从墨水槽中吸取墨水。

As the needle pierces, it injects ink into the middle layer of your skin.

当针头刺入时，它会将墨水注入皮肤的中间层。

With each puncture, the ink settles(沉降) among the cells, forming the design.

每次穿刺，墨水都会沉积在细胞间，形成图案。

This repetitive action builds the tattoo layer by layer, allowing the creation of detailed designs.

这种重复的动作一层一层地构建纹身，从而实现精细的图案设计。

### [The Baker Street Bank Heist 😨](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VDVkjTVA87s)

A group of robbers began digging a tunnel beneath Baker Street in London in 1971.

1971 年，一伙劫匪开始在伦敦贝克街下挖掘一条隧道。

Their goal was to break into the vault of Lloyd's Bank next door.

他们的目标是闯入隔壁的劳埃德银行金库。

You see, they rented a nearby store and used it as their base, working every weekend night to dig through the ground towards the vault.

他们租下了附近的一家商店，并将其作为基地，每个周末夜晚都在挖掘通往金库的隧道。

The timing was perfect — **roadwork**(道路维修) had disabled the vault's **floor alarms**(地板警报).

时机非常完美——道路施工使金库的地板警报失效了。

Using **walkie-talkies**(步话机) to communicate, they thought they were in the clear.

他们用对讲机进行沟通，认为一切都很顺利。

But someone overheard their conversation and called the police.

但有人听到了他们的对话并报警了。

Officers checked the vault door, but since it was still locked, they didn't think anything was wrong.

警察检查了金库门，但因为门还是锁着的，他们没有发现异常。

The robbers escaped with £3 million, about $51 million today.

劫匪带着 300 万英镑（相当于今天的 5100 万美元）逃走了。

But it only burned for 45 minutes, which isn't long enough to turn bones into ash.

但火只烧了 45 分钟，这不足以将骨头烧成灰烬。

Now, some thought the kids had been kidnapped, and others even claimed to see the children alive hundreds of miles away.

有人认为孩子们被绑架了，还有人声称在数百英里外看到过这些孩子还活着。

The parents never stopped searching, convinced the fire wasn't the end of their children.

### [Why Runners Poop Themselves 😨](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K6XSpw54FKk)

Poop ran down her legs as she pushed through the marathon, determined to cross the finish line.

她一边跑马拉松一边大便顺着腿往下流，但她决心冲过终点线。

When runners push their bodies to the limit, blood flows away from the **gut**(肠) to power the muscles.

当跑者将身体推向极限时，血液会从肠道流向肌肉以提供动力。

Plus, the constant bouncing **sloshes**(晃动) food in the stomach, and pre-race nerves all contribute to the need to go to the bathroom.

此外，持续的颠簸会搅动胃里的食物，加上赛前的紧张情绪，这些都会让人产生如厕的需求。

So, a lot of runners will either choose to or accidentally poop themselves instead.

因此，许多跑者要么选择在跑步中排便，要么会意外排便在身上。

### [How To Milk A Cow 🤔](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/R-wRqtlpeBs)

The **teats**(乳头) are held firmly, and the milker gently pulls down.

挤奶者稳稳地抓住乳头，然后轻轻向下拉。

This motion triggers the release of **oxytocin**(催产素), the **hormone**(激素) that bonds a cow to her calf.

这种动作会触发催产素的释放，这是一种使母牛与小牛建立联系的激素。

The muscles in the **udder**(乳房) then contract, pushing the milk through the ducts and into the teats.

此时乳房中的肌肉会收缩，将牛奶通过乳管推入乳头中。

It then streams into a bucket where it's collected.

牛奶随后流入桶中，被收集起来。

The cow is given a treat, and the milker gets to keep the fresh milk.

母牛得到奖赏，而挤奶者则得到新鲜的牛奶。

### [Shooting A Really Thick Book 😮](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JnBSEil1SsU)

If you shoot a bullet at a really thick book, some people think it would go right through.

如果你朝一本非常厚的书开枪，有些人认为子弹会直接穿过去。

But is that actually true?

但事实真的如此吗？

Well, as the bullet enters the book, each page creates friction that slows it down.

当子弹进入书中时，每一页都会产生摩擦力，使其减速。

The dense layers of paper fibers absorb the bullet's energy, causing it to decelerate rapidly.

密集的纸纤维层会吸收子弹的能量，使其迅速减速。

And in many cases, especially with handguns, the bullet probably wouldn't make it all the way through if the book is at least 7 inches thick.

在许多情况下，尤其是用手枪时，如果书至少有 7 英寸厚，子弹可能根本穿不过去。

### [How Deadfall Traps Work 🤔](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HdIwM_6H9oQ)

The trap is made up of three sticks to balance a heavy weight like a rock above the ground.

陷阱由三根棍子组成，用来支撑地面上方的重物，例如一块石头。

But once the bait stick is moved, the structure collapses, and the weight drops quickly.

但一旦诱饵棍被移动，结构就会坍塌，重物迅速坠落。

This sudden force is enough to trap or kill the prey instantly.

这种突然的力量足以立即困住或杀死猎物。

It's a simple yet deadly design, using gravity and the animal's own movements to set off the trap.

这是一个简单却致命的设计，利用重力和动物自身的动作触发陷阱。

### [Spider Silk As A Bulletproof Vest? 🤔](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IqYdMqnyjE8)

If you shot at a massive amount of tightly woven strands of spider silk, the force might actually be absorbed, and the bullet could be stopped.

如果你朝大量紧密编织的蜘蛛丝射击，冲击力可能会被吸收，子弹可能会被阻挡。

This is because spider silk is made of proteins that are incredibly stretchy and strong.

这是因为蜘蛛丝由非常有弹性且坚韧的蛋白质组成。

As the silk stretches, it could distribute the force over a larger area, reducing the impact.

当蜘蛛丝被拉伸时，它可以将力量分散到更大的面积上，从而减少冲击力。

In theory, if you were able to weave enough to fix onto a vest, it might actually work as bulletproof armor.

理论上，如果你能编织出足够多的蜘蛛丝并将其固定在背心上，它或许真的可以充当防弹护甲。

### [Water On A Grease Fire 🤯](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fQ7aK9uxyWs)

When you pour water on a grease fire, the water quickly sinks below the burning oil.

当你往油火上倒水时，水会很快沉到燃烧的油下方。

The intense heat instantly converts the water into steam, which expands violently.

If you fall into a volcano crater, you should try to grab onto a ledge before you hit the bottom.

如果你掉进了火山口，你应该试图抓住岩壁边缘，在到达底部之前停住。

If you can't, stand on your backpack to get away from the heat.

如果抓不住，可以站在背包上以远离高温。

Now, this intense heat can cause burns even without direct contact.

这种强烈的热量即使没有直接接触，也会导致烧伤。

So, cover your face and body with any available material to shield yourself.

因此，用任何可用的材料遮住脸和身体以保护自己。

You should also move quickly away from the lava flow to avoid toxic gases like sulfur dioxide, which can overwhelm you.

你还应该迅速远离熔岩流，以避免像二氧化硫这样的有毒气体，它会让你窒息。

If no rescue is coming, find a safe route to climb out.

但拔出刀子可能会让出血更严重，因为刀刃可能实际上在堵住伤口。

Instead, apply pressure around the wound to help control the bleeding.

相反，应该在伤口周围施加压力以帮助控制出血。

Try to elevate the injured area above your heart to slow down blood loss.

尝试将受伤部位抬高到心脏以上，以减缓失血速度。

Call emergency services immediately and try to relax in the meantime.

立即拨打急救电话，同时尽量保持冷静。

But that's not actually what would happen.

但实际上并不会这样。

The bullet can ricochet off the metal walls, bouncing unpredictably and hitting unintended targets.

子弹可能会从金属墙壁上反弹，方向不可预测，并击中意外的目标。

But the submarine's walls are thick enough to withstand the impact without causing structural damage.

但潜艇的墙壁足够厚，可以承受冲击而不造成结构损坏。

Now, it could hit vital systems like pipes or control panels, which could lead to leaks and malfunctions.

不过，子弹可能会击中关键系统，比如管道或控制面板，这可能导致泄漏或故障。

### [How A Well Works 🤔](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VtA_dVlT9AU)

A well is drilled deep into the ground until it reaches groundwater.

一口井会被深深钻入地下，直到到达地下水。

This water comes from rain that seeps into the ground, **collecting**(聚集) in the spaces between rocks and soil.

这些水源自渗入地下的雨水，汇集在岩石和土壤之间的空隙中。

Once the drill hits the water, a pipe is placed inside the well to create a path for the water to travel up.

一旦钻头接触到水，就会在井中放置一根管道，为水向上流动创造通道。

A pump is used to suck the water from the ground, moving it through the pipe and to the surface.

From there, the water travels through the pipes and straight to your house.

从那里，水通过管道直接流向你的家。

### [Why This Cup Empties Itself 🤔](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_xTzN462RT8)

Once the water is poured above this column, the cup will automatically drain it completely.

一旦水倒过这个柱子上方，杯子就会自动完全排空。

This happens because inside the column there's a hidden open channel.

这是因为柱子内部有一个隐藏的开放通道。

This channel extends from the bottom of the stem to the top of the column and back to the bottom of the cup.

该通道从茎的底部延伸到柱子的顶部，然后再回到杯子的底部。

As you pour, the water rises and starts to flow into this channel.

当你倒水时，水会上升并开始流入这个通道。

Once the water level reaches this point at the top, gravity makes it begin to fall, which triggers a **siphon**(虹吸) effect.

一旦水位到达顶部的这一点，重力会使其开始下落，从而触发虹吸效应。

This causes the cup to completely drain through the bottom.

这会导致杯子从底部完全排空。

绵羊被引导进入这个笼子，顶部被关闭，将它们固定在原地。  

Then it lowers into a tank filled with a parasite treatment.  

然后笼子被放入一个装满寄生虫处理液的水槽中。  

The sheep are completely submerged into the liquid for a few seconds.  

绵羊会被完全浸入液体中几秒钟。  

Then the cage lifts the sheep back out of the dip, and excess liquid **drains off**(流走).  

接着笼子将绵羊提起，多余的液体会流掉。  

The process repeats two to three times to make sure the sheep are fully **coated**(覆盖) in the parasite treatment.  

这个过程会重复两到三次，以确保绵羊完全被寄生虫处理液覆盖。

它反复从他们头顶俯冲，发出恐怖的尖叫声。  

They finally lost it but were left shaken, convinced they had encountered something supernatural.  

他们终于摆脱了它，但被吓得心惊肉跳，确信自己遇到了超自然现象。  

This terrifying case became one of the most famous Mothman sightings.  

这一恐怖事件成为最著名的“飞蛾人”目击事件之一。  

These unverified sightings began to spread fear throughout West Virginia.  

这些未经证实的目击事件开始在西弗吉尼亚州引发恐慌。  

Now, most believe it was simply a local legend fueled by fear and hysteria, but with no concrete evidence, the Mothman remains an eerie mystery.  

如今，大多数人认为这只是由恐惧和歇斯底里引发的地方传说，但由于没有确凿证据，“飞蛾人”依然是一个令人毛骨悚然的谜团。

### [Australian Stinging Tree](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uE2N9sqM4pQ)

If you touch an Australian stinging tree, the leaves are actually covered in tiny needle-like hairs that inject venom into your skin.  

如果你碰到澳大利亚刺树，它的叶子上实际上覆盖着微小的针状毛，会将毒液注入你的皮肤。  

This venom causes intense pain that can last for a long time.  

这种毒液会引起剧烈的疼痛，且疼痛可能持续很长时间。  

And if you try to remove the hairs with your hands, you might break them, causing more pain.  

如果你试图用手移除这些毛，可能会弄断它们，从而引发更大的疼痛。  

So instead, you should apply sticky tape and peel it off slowly.  

因此，你应该使用粘胶带，慢慢撕下来。  

This will pull out the hairs intact, reducing the pain and irritation.  

这样可以完整地拔出毛刺，从而减轻疼痛和刺激。

### [A Metal Guard Rail Accident](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_KkLrAVLfOY)

A metal guard rail shot through the windshield, impaling a man in the front seat.

During surgery, doctors carefully removed the pole, avoiding major blood vessels and vital organs.  

在手术过程中，医生小心地取出了杆子，避免伤及主要血管和重要器官。  

And the man ended up living.  

最终，这名男子活了下来。  

### [Explosive Ant Defense](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Nyhl1I_qyUc)

The ant contracts their abdominal muscles with such force that their bodies literally rupture inside.  

蚂蚁用极大的力量收缩腹部肌肉，导致它们的身体内部直接破裂。  

They have specialized glands filled with a toxic, sticky substance.  

它们有专门的腺体，里面充满了有毒的粘性物质。  

As their bodies burst, this lethal goo is explosively sprayed onto their enemies, coating them in the sticky toxin.  

当它们的身体爆裂时，这种致命的粘稠物质会被喷射到敌人身上，将其覆盖在粘性毒素中。  

The explosion not only immobilizes and often kills the attacking predator, but it also kills the ant in the process.  

这种爆裂不仅会让攻击的捕食者无法动弹，甚至经常会杀死它们，同时也会让蚂蚁自己死亡。  

This selfless act is a last-resort defense mechanism where the ant gives up its life to protect the colony.  

这种无私的行为是一种最后的防御机制，蚂蚁牺牲自己来保护蚁群。  

### [Concrete Mixer Truck](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cxOhJ9UnUqM)

The drum constantly rotates, keeping the wet concrete moving inside.  

搅拌筒不断旋转，使湿混凝土在里面保持流动。  

But if you left it in here for too long, the concrete would still harden despite the movement.  

但如果它在里面待得太久，即使在运动中，混凝土仍然会硬化。  

This is because the drum's purpose is just to keep the concrete mixed evenly so it's ready to pour.  

这是因为搅拌筒的作用只是将混凝土均匀混合，以便随时倒出。  

But if the truck is delayed, that concrete can harden right inside of it, turning it into a massive, immovable block.  

但如果卡车延误，这些混凝土会直接在里面硬化，变成一个巨大的、无法移动的硬块。  

### [Falling Bullets](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FIBhy-m41oc)

If you shot a gun straight up in the air, could the bullet come back down and kill you?  

如果你把枪对着天空开枪，子弹会不会掉下来杀死你呢？  

Well, when a bullet is fired this way, gravity will eventually stop it and pull it back down.  

事实上，当子弹这样发射时，重力最终会让它停止并将其拉回地面。  

And even though it isn't moving as fast as when it was first fired, it can still reach dangerous speeds.  

即使它的速度没有最初发射时那么快，它仍然可以达到危险的速度。  

The chances might be low that it actually hits you, but if it does, it's likely to strike a vital area like your head.  

虽然它真正击中你的概率很低，但如果击中，很可能会打到像头部这样的要害部位。  

### [Biting Through Bone](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/11MJRIElo8A)

If you could bite through a carrot, some people think this means you could bite through your own finger.  

如果你能咬断一根胡萝卜，有些人认为这意味着你可以咬断自己的手指。  

But biting through a carrot only takes about 45 lbs of force, and just fracturing a human finger requires around 335 lbs of force.  

但咬断一根胡萝卜只需要大约45磅的力，而仅仅折断一根人的手指就需要大约335磅的力。  

The average human only has a bite force of around 160 lbs, which isn't enough to break through bone.  

平均来说，人类的咬合力只有大约160磅，这不足以咬穿骨头。  

And even if you somehow did have enough force to bite off your own finger, your brain's pain response would stop you before you could finish the act.  

即使你确实有足够的力量咬掉自己的手指，你的大脑的痛觉反应也会在你完成行为之前阻止你。

### [Bear Spray vs. Polar Bear](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b7Q8Rrds56k)

Bear spray might help if you're being attacked by a polar bear.  

如果你遭到北极熊的攻击，熊喷雾可能会有所帮助。  

It's made from concentrated **capsaicin**(辣椒素/kæpˈseɪsɪn/), the active ingredient in chili peppers.  

它是由浓缩辣椒素制成的，这是一种辣椒的活性成分。  

When you spray it, the capsaicin causes intense burning in the bear's eyes, nose, and lungs.  

当你喷出它时，辣椒素会导致熊的眼睛、鼻子和肺部剧烈灼烧。  

Temporarily blinding and overwhelming the animal's senses.  

暂时使熊失明并压制其感官。  

This gives you crucial time to escape, as the bear is likely to be **incapacitated**(使丧失能力 => capacitate(使有资格/获能)).  

这为你争取了关键的逃生时间，因为熊可能会被暂时制服。  

### [Deadly Dose of Caffeine](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bt7zgl3Ia1w)

If you drank 70 cups of coffee, the amount of caffeine could easily kill you.  

如果你喝了70杯咖啡，这样的咖啡因量可能会轻易致命。  

But just a few teaspoons of caffeine powder can be even more dangerous.  

但是，仅仅几茶匙的咖啡因粉就更加危险。  

You see, a single teaspoon of caffeine powder is equivalent to about 28 cups of coffee.  

一茶匙咖啡因粉大约相当于28杯咖啡的量。  

In 2019, a man accidentally mixed in too much of this powder in his drink.  

2019年，一名男子不小心在饮料中加入了过量的咖啡因粉。  

It was the equivalent to 200 cups of coffee.  

这相当于200杯咖啡的量。  

This led to his heart beating extremely fast; he started foaming at the mouth before eventually dying.  

结果导致他的心脏跳动极快，嘴里开始吐白沫，最终不幸去世。  

### [Roman Shield vs. Gunshot](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Q5M-zZK_E1E)

If you shoot a gun at a Roman shield, you might think that it would block the hit.  

如果你用枪射击罗马盾牌，你可能会认为它可以挡住子弹。  

But these shields were made of wood, which would absorb some impact but not stop a bullet.  

但这些盾牌是用木头制成的，它们可以吸收一些冲击，但挡不住子弹。  

Now, these shields often had a raised section made of metal at the center of the shield.  

这些盾牌通常在中心有一个金属制成的凸起部分。  

This part could potentially deflect a bullet if it were hit at precisely the right angle.  

如果以非常精准的角度击中，这部分可能会偏转子弹。  

But overall, it's still unlikely.  

但总体来说，这种可能性很低。  

### [Skateboarding Down the Hoover Dam](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-MohyNaIDgg)

If you skateboarded down the Hoover Dam, the slope would rapidly accelerate you.  

如果你在胡佛大坝上滑板，这个坡度会迅速加速你。  

Reaching speeds of up to 50 to 90 mph and beyond.  

速度可能会达到每小时50到90英里，甚至更高。  

Now, the curvature of the dam structure would make it incredibly difficult to maintain control.  

而大坝结构的弧度会让保持控制变得非常困难。  

And if you somehow manage to stay on, the friction between the wheels and the concrete would probably start to generate some heat.  

即使你设法保持在滑板上，轮子与混凝土之间的摩擦可能会开始产生热量。  

Some people might think it could get so hot that it would start to burn the board and your feet, but this probably wouldn't happen.  

有些人可能认为热量会高到燃烧滑板和你的脚，但这可能不会发生。  

Approaching the bottom, the rapid deceleration would be abrupt.  

接近底部时，快速的减速会非常突然。  

### [How a Flare Gun Works](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8YGQMOYCFDs)

When you pull the trigger of a flare gun, it releases a firing pin that strikes a primer at the base of the flare cartridge.  

当你扣动信号枪的扳机时，它会释放一个撞针，撞击信号弹底部的底火。  

This impact ignites a small propellant charge, creating a burst of gas that propels the flare out of the barrel.  

这种撞击点燃了一小部分推进剂，产生的气体将信号弹推出枪管。  

Inside the flare, there's a delayed charge which allows it to reach a higher altitude before it bursts into a bright burning signal.  

信号弹内部有一个延迟引信，使其能够在爆发成明亮燃烧的信号之前达到更高的高度。

### [A Girl's Mysterious Disappearance](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OK8_1KGzt5U)

Her car was unlocked, and her cards and phone were missing, but all her other belongings were left behind.  

她的车没有上锁，她的银行卡和手机不见了，但其他物品都留在了车上。  

A massive search ensued, but no trace of her was ever found.  

随后展开了大规模搜寻，但始终没有发现她的踪迹。  

Theories about her disappearance range from foul play to voluntary disappearance, but none have been proven.  

关于她失踪的理论从他杀到主动失踪不等，但都没有被证实。  

And to this day, her case remains unsolved.  

至今，她的案件仍然未解。  

### [How Dentists Fix Chipped Teeth](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dv7oHrm2aug)

If you chip a piece off of your tooth, a dentist might shave down the surrounding area.  

如果你牙齿缺了一小块，牙医可能会修整周围的区域。  

Then, a bonding material that matches your tooth color is applied and shaped to match the original appearance.  

然后，牙医会涂上一种与牙齿颜色匹配的粘结材料，并将其塑造成原来的外形。  

Once the shape is near perfect, a special light hardens the material, making it as durable as the tooth.  

形状接近完美后，特殊光线会使材料硬化，使其与牙齿一样坚固。  

Finally, the dentist polishes the tooth to blend it seamlessly with the others.  

最后，牙医会给牙齿抛光，使其与其他牙齿完美融合。  

### [The Viking Shield Wall](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iIRjIYfXECE)

Viking warriors would lock their shields together, forming a solid wall.  

维京战士会将他们的盾牌锁在一起，形成一道坚固的盾墙。  

This shield wall acted as a barrier, protecting them from arrows and incoming attacks.  

这道盾墙可以作为屏障，保护他们免受箭矢和来袭攻击。  

As the enemy approached, the Vikings would just keep pushing forward.  

当敌人接近时，维京人会不断向前推。  

They would use the gaps between the shields to thrust their spears out, attacking their foes while staying protected.  

他们会利用盾牌之间的缝隙将长矛刺出，在保护自己的同时攻击敌人。  

Now, despite its strengths, the shield wall still had vulnerabilities and could be broken

 by concentrated attacks.  

尽管盾墙坚固，但它仍然有弱点，可以被集中攻击突破。  

### [Showering During a Storm Is Dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4t-v1Fev5A8)

If you shower during a storm, lightning could strike your home and send electrical energy through the plumbing system.  

如果你在暴风雨中洗澡，闪电可能击中你的房屋，并通过管道系统传导电能。  

In rare instances, this current could travel through metal pipes and reach the water inside them.  

在极少数情况下，这种电流可能会通过金属管道传导到其中的水。  

Since water can act as a conductor of electricity, the current can move quickly through it.  

由于水可以作为电的导体，电流会迅速通过水流动。  

If you're in the shower when this happens, the electricity could pass through the water and into your body.  

如果这种情况发生时你正在洗澡，电流可能会通过水进入你的身体。  

This could potentially cause serious injury.  

这可能会导致严重的伤害。  

### [The Frozen Woman Who Survived](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T-fZaWliS0I)

A woman collapsed in freezing weather while walking to find help after crashing her car.  

一名女子在车祸后步行寻找帮助时倒在了冰天雪地中。  

She was just 15 feet away from a house, but no one knew she was there.  

她距离一栋房子只有15英尺，但没有人知道她在那里。  

She was found 6 hours later, completely frozen.  

六小时后，她被发现时已经完全冻僵了。  

Her skin was so hard it couldn't be pierced with a needle, and her body temperature was so low it didn't even register on a **thermometer**(温度计).  

她的皮肤硬得连针都刺不进去，她的体温低到连温度计都无法测量。  

Doctors assumed she was dead, but they slowly warmed her with heating pads.  

医生认为她已经死亡，但他们用加热垫慢慢为她升温。  

Amazingly, she woke up and made a full recovery with no long-term damage.  

神奇的是，她醒了过来，并完全康复，没有留下任何长期伤害。

### [How Reinforced Car Doors Stop Bullets](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bnyhksycXY4)

If you shoot at a reinforced car door, the outer metal layer absorbs the energy from the initial impact, which slows down the bullet.  

如果你朝强化车门开枪，外层金属会吸收初始撞击的能量，从而减缓子弹的速度。  

And this is because engineers actually begin to reinforce the car by stripping it down to its frame.  

这是因为工程师首先会将汽车拆解到车架。  

Then they add layers of hardened steel to the body, creating a tough barrier that resists bullet penetration.  

然后他们在车身上添加多层硬化钢，形成抵抗子弹穿透的坚固屏障。  

Now, if the bullet does happen to get through, the doors are filled with **ballistic**(弹道的/射击的/bəˈlɪstɪk/) **fiberglass**(玻璃纤维) that catches and slows them down.  

如果子弹真的穿透了车门，车门内部填充的防弹玻璃纤维会拦截并进一步减缓子弹。  

### [Why Pilots Can't Have Beards](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yezgIjS8Q8I)

When a pilot puts on an oxygen mask in an emergency, it forms a tight seal around the face.  

飞行员在紧急情况下戴上氧气面罩时，面罩会紧贴面部形成密封。  

And this is crucial for supplying the right amount of oxygen.  

这对于提供足够的氧气至关重要。  

But if a pilot had a beard, the facial hair would prevent the mask from sealing properly, causing the oxygen to leak.  

但如果飞行员留着胡子，面部毛发会妨碍面罩的正常密封，导致氧气泄漏。  

Potentially, this could lead to unfortunate consequences, and this is why you typically never see a pilot with a beard.  

这可能导致严重后果，这也是为什么你通常看不到留胡子的飞行员。  

### [The Miracle of the Man Impaled by a Metal Rod](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oUeScywg7r8)

A meter-long metal rod impaled a man's head during a car accident in 2018.  

2018年，一根一米长的金属杆在车祸中刺穿了一名男子的头部。  

The rod pierced through his skull, entering just above his eye and exiting through the side of his head.  

金属杆穿过了他的头骨，从眼睛上方进入并从头部侧面穿出。  

Miraculously, it missed vital areas of the brain and major blood vessels, sparing his life.  

奇迹般地，它避开了大脑的重要区域和主要血管，保住了他的性命。  

The operation was delicate and lasted several hours, but they successfully removed the rod without further damage.  

手术非常精细，持续了几个小时，但医生成功地取出了金属杆，没有造成进一步伤害。  

The man ended up living.  

最终，这名男子幸存了下来。  

### [Does Swallowing Gum Really Take 7 Years to Digest?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zXvBrQ1gKDA)

If you swallow gum, some people believe that it sits in your stomach for over 7 years.  

如果你吞下口香糖，有人认为它会在你的胃里停留超过7年。  

But is that actually true? Well, your stomach acid can't break down the gum like it does with other foods.  

但这是真的吗？其实你的胃酸不像对待其他食物那样能够分解口香糖。  

But this doesn't mean it just sits there forever.  

但这并不意味着它会永远留在胃里。  

The gum passes through your digestive system largely intact, moving through the intestines until finally it exits your body.  

口香糖会基本保持完整地通过你的消化系统，经过肠道，最终排出体外。  

And *klunks* in the toilet.  

然后“咔哒”一声掉进马桶里。  

### [The Man Injured by a Ricocheting Bulle](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lN33EJQmUWY) [t](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lN33EJQmUWY)

A man fired a revolver at an armadillo in 2015, but armadillo's skin is tough because it contains a layer of **bony**(骨制的/骨瘦如柴的) plates.  

2015年，一名男子朝犰狳开了一枪，但犰狳的皮肤非常坚硬，因为它含有一层骨质板。  

These plates create a hard protective shell that shields the animal.  

这些骨质板形成了一个坚硬的保护壳，保护犰狳不受伤害。  

Because of this, the bullet actually ricocheted off and headed back towards the man.  

因此，子弹实际上反弹了回来，飞向了那名男子。  

It ended up hitting him right in the jaw, causing significant injury.  

最终，它击中了他的下巴，造成了严重伤害。  

He was rushed to the hospital, where he underwent surgery to repair the damage.  

他被紧急送往医院，并接受手术修复了伤势。

### [Why Do Snakes "Dance" to Music?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_QWmCTF1eYg)

A snake appears to dance to music if you play this flute in front of it, and you might think that they're just enjoying the tune.  

如果你在蛇面前吹笛子，它看起来像是在随着音乐跳舞，你可能会以为它在享受旋律。  

But these snakes are actually deaf to airborne sounds. Instead, the movement is based on sight and the vibrations it feels through the ground.  

但实际上，这些蛇对空气传播的声音是听不见的。它们的动作是基于视觉以及通过地面感受到的震动。  

As the **charmer**(魔术师) moves, the snake tracks the movement, often perceived as a threat or curiosity.  

当蛇舞者移动时，蛇会追踪这种动作，通常将其视为威胁或出于好奇。  

The snake's dance is actually a defensive behavior, not a reaction to music.  

蛇的“舞蹈”实际上是一种防御行为，而不是对音乐的反应。  

### [What Are Tracer Rounds and How Do They Work?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/r2gJI-mjkpY)

When a gun fires a **tracer round**(曳光弹), a chemical compound ignites in the base of the bullet.  

当枪发射曳光弹时，子弹底部的化学化合物会被点燃。  

This compound burns brightly, creating a visible trail and making the bullet's path easy to track.  

这种化合物会燃烧得很亮，形成一条可见的轨迹，使子弹的路径容易追踪。  

This helps shooters adjust their aim by being able to see the trajectory of the bullet.  

这有助于射手通过观察子弹轨迹来调整瞄准。  

At night, the fiery **streak**(条痕) can light up their surroundings, adding a dramatic effect.  

在夜间，燃烧的轨迹甚至可以照亮周围环境，增添戏剧效果。  

### [The Danger of Swallowing Tapeworm Pills](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/i6wdMQHw2-s)

Some people swallow a pill containing a live tapeworm **cyst**(囊).  

有些人会吞下一颗含有活绦虫囊的药丸。  

Once inside the digestive system, the cyst hatches, releasing the tapeworm larvae.  

一旦进入消化系统，囊会孵化，释放出绦虫幼虫。  

It would then latch onto the intestines and start feeding on the nutrients from the food the person ate.  

接着，它会附着在肠道上，开始吸收人类食物中的营养。  

This would lead to weight loss because the parasite was essentially consuming part of the person's meals.  

这会导致体重下降，因为寄生虫实际上在消耗一部分食物营养。  

However, this diet was incredibly dangerous, leading to malnutrition, serious side effects, and sometimes even death.  

然而，这种减肥方式极其危险，可能导致营养不良、严重副作用，甚至死亡。  

### [Man Bitten by Snake While Using Toilet](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MMJOwBBF_54)

A snake bit a man while he was sitting on the toilet in Malaysia.  

一条蛇在马来西亚咬了一名正在上厕所的男子。  

He was playing a video game, completely unaware of the danger lurking below.  

他当时正在玩电子游戏，完全没有注意到脚下潜伏的危险。  

Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain on his butt.  

突然，他感到屁股一阵剧痛。  

He looked down and saw a snake clamped onto his skin.  

他低头一看，发现一条蛇咬住了他的皮肤。  

In a panic, he jumped up and yanked it off. This caused the snake to retreat back into the toilet while he rushed to leave the bathroom, smashing the door in the process.  

他惊慌之下跳起来，把蛇扯了下来。蛇退回到马桶里，而他则匆忙逃离浴室，撞坏了门。 `

### [How Rifling Makes Bullets More Accurate](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-eR56LiKLcw)

As a bullet is propelled down the barrel, it's surrounded by these spiral grooves known as **rifling**(膛线).  

当子弹被推进枪管时，它会被称为膛线的螺旋凹槽包围。  

And this forces the bullet to spin rapidly as it exits the barrel.  

这使得子弹在离开枪管时快速旋转。  

This spin stabilizes the bullet during flight, maintaining a straight **trajectory**(轨道/轨迹/trəˈdʒektəri/).  

这种旋转在飞行过程中稳定了子弹，使其保持直线轨迹。  

Now, if a bullet didn't spin, it would **tumble**(跌倒/跌跌撞撞走) and **veer**(转向) off course, losing accuracy.  

如果子弹不旋转，它会翻滚并偏离轨道，失去精准度。  

The spin also helps the bullet to cut through air resistance more effectively.  

旋转还可以帮助子弹更有效地突破空气阻力。

### [How to Treat a Sea Urchin Sting](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kN-79T4JTc4)

If you step on a sea **urchin**(海胆/刺猬/顽童), their spines can lodge deep into your skin.  

如果你踩到海胆，它们的刺可能会深深地扎入你的皮肤。  

And if you try to just **yank**(猛拉) them out right away, they might snap off, leaving fragments stuck under the surface.  

如果你试图直接将它们拉出来，它们可能会断裂，留下碎片嵌在皮肤下面。  

Instead, you should use tweezers to pull out the bigger visible spines, then **soak**(浸泡) the area in warm water and vinegar for the smaller embedded ones.  

相反，你应该用镊子将较大的可见刺拔出，然后将受伤部位浸泡在温水和醋中，以处理较小的嵌入刺。  

While this won't completely dissolve them, it'll **loosen**(使松弛) things up a little when you dig out the remaining pieces.  

虽然这无法完全溶解它们，但可以让剩余的刺更容易被取出。  

### [What Happens When You Overeat?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1om3rLX5oYI)

When you overeat, your stomach has to stretch to accommodate the extra food.  

当你暴饮暴食时，你的胃不得不伸展以容纳多余的食物。  

And if the expansion is rapid and extreme, the pressure inside it increases significantly.  

如果扩张迅速且过度，胃内的压力会显著增加。  

If you keep eating more and more, like an unnatural amount of food, the pressure could become too great.  

如果你继续吃得越来越多，比如非常不正常的食物量，压力可能会变得过大。  

And there's a small chance it could actually cause the stomach wall to tear open.  

有很小的可能会导致胃壁撕裂。  

This rupture leads to the contents of your stomach spilling into the **abdominal cavity**(腹腔), which can cause severe pain and infection.  

这种撕裂会导致胃内容物泄漏到腹腔，引起剧烈疼痛和感染。  

### [How Old Rifles Are Loaded](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/by1eEGc8BWc)

Pouring gunpowder down the barrel is the first step to loading an old rifle.  

将火药倒入枪管是装填老式步枪的第一步。  

Next, you place a lead ball wrapped in a **lubricated cloth**(润滑布) down the barrel, sitting it on top of the powder.  

接着，你将一颗包裹在润滑布中的铅球放入枪管，置于火药之上。  

Using a thin rod, you push the bullet down to ensure it's tightly packed.  

用细杆将子弹推下去，确保它被紧紧压实。  

Then, you take a small amount of gunpowder and place it in the flash pan.

### [Why Overloaded Outlets Cause Fires](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ZHp7uUqm218)

If you plug too many devices into an outlet, the electrical current can exceed its capacity.  

如果你在插座上插入太多设备，电流可能会超过其承载能力。  

And this excess current generates heat, which begins to warm the outlet and its wires.  

这种过量电流会产生热量，导致插座及其电线开始发热。  

As the wires overheat, the insulation around them starts to melt.  

当电线过热时，其周围的绝缘层会开始融化。  

Once the insulation is compromised, bare wires can touch, creating sparks.  

一旦绝缘层受损，裸露的电线可能会接触，从而产生火花。  

If these sparks get big enough, they can actually ignite nearby flammable materials.  

如果这些火花足够大，它们可能会点燃附近的易燃材料。  

### [Why Traffic Jams Happen Without a Crash](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/I32w7-6lznQ)

When you're stuck in traffic, you might assume there's an accident ahead.  

当你被困在交通堵塞中时，你可能会认为前方发生了事故。  

But sometimes the **backup**(堵塞/支援/备用/备份) clears, and there's no crash. So what happened?  

但有时堵车消失了，却没有事故。那么到底发生了什么？  

Well, anytime one car slows down, the driver behind them also has to hit their brakes.  

事实上，每当一辆车减速时，后面的司机也不得不踩刹车。  

This causes the driver behind them to slow down as well.  

这会导致后面的司机也随之减速。  

Eventually, someone down the line will come to a complete stop.  

最终，队伍中的某个人会完全停下来。  

And when this happens, the cars behind that driver also have to stop, causing a traffic jam without a clear, obvious reason.  

一旦这种情况发生，那名司机后面的车辆也不得不停下，从而造成没有明显原因的交通堵塞。

### [How Ants Survive Flooding](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rz_IpdnNJJM)

If an anthill floods, worker ants quickly gather the queen and larvae, prioritizing their safety.  

如果蚁丘被淹，工蚁会迅速聚集蚁后和幼虫，优先确保它们的安全。  

Next, they link their bodies together, forming a living raft that floats on the water's surface.  

接着，它们将身体连接在一起，形成一个漂浮在水面上的活筏。  

This raft protects the queen and young ants at the center, ensuring their survival.  

这个活筏保护了蚁后和幼蚁在中心位置，从而确保它们的存活。  

The ants on the **bottom row** work together and rotate to avoid drowning.

The prairie dog vacuum is placed over the tunnel entrance, creating a powerful suction.  

草原犬鼠真空吸引器被放置在地洞入口处，产生强大的吸力。  

As the vacuum starts, the air pressure within the tunnel drops rapidly, pulling the prairie dog upward at nearly 50 mph.  

随着真空吸引器启动，洞内的气压迅速下降，将草原犬鼠以接近50英里每小时的速度吸出。  

The sudden rush of air lifts the animal out of its burrow and into the suction tube, where it's finally slowed down and dropped into a soft cushion chamber.  

突如其来的气流将这只动物从洞中提起，吸入管道，最后减速并掉进一个软垫舱中。  

This is where they stay until they are relocated.  

它们会在这里停留，直到被重新安置。  

### [The Miracle on the Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lnR-GgDoLAs)

### [The Correct Brace Position During a Plane Crash](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eJx-j6SpEgI)

If you're on a plane that's crashing, most people think they should brace by curling into a ball, but that's not actually what you should do.  

如果你在一架即将坠毁的飞机上，大多数人认为应该蜷缩成一团，但实际上这并不是正确的做法。  

Instead, **assume**(做出) the brace position by leaning forward and covering your head.  

正确的方法是身体前倾，用双手护住头部。  

This position helps protect your vital organs and reduces the risk of head and neck injuries.  

这种姿势可以保护你的重要器官，并降低头部和颈部受伤的风险。

如果你处于毒蛇的攻击范围内，你可能会本能地逃跑，但突然的动作可能会更加激怒蛇。  

Instead, stay calm and back away slowly without making any sudden gestures.  

相反，你应该保持冷静，慢慢后退，不要做任何突然的动作。  

If the snake strikes, try to put a barrier between you, like a jacket.  

如果蛇发起攻击，试着用一件夹克等物品作为屏障挡在你和蛇之间。  

And if you are bitten, try not to panic because it will increase your heart rate, which will spread the venom more quickly.  

如果被咬，不要惊慌，因为惊慌会加速心率，从而使毒液扩散得更快。

This bizarre World War II weapon was developed by the **Brits**(英国人) and was known as the explosive rat.  

这种奇特的二战武器由英国人发明，被称为“爆炸老鼠”。  

The plan was that when the rats were found, they would just be tossed in the boilers to be **incinerated**(焚烧).  

计划是，当这些老鼠被发现时，它们会被直接扔进锅炉焚烧。  

The heat would then trigger the detonation, causing a devastating explosion.  

高温会引发爆炸，造成毁灭性的破坏。  

Although the explosive rats were intercepted by the Germans, so none of them ever actually exploded.

### [Will Shooting a Propane Tank Cause an Explosion?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wY8Psn1TboA)

If you shoot at a propane tank, most people assume it will explode spectacularly. But is this actually true?  

如果你向一个丙烷罐开枪，大多数人会认为它会发生壮观的爆炸。但这是真的吗？  

Well, propane tanks are designed to withstand significant impact and pressure.  

实际上，丙烷罐是专门设计来承受巨大的冲击和压力的。  

When a bullet penetrates it, it may cause a leak as the propane escapes in gas form.  

当子弹穿透罐体时，它可能会导致气体泄漏，因为丙烷以气体形式逸出。  

However, for an explosion to occur, the gas needs to mix with air in the right proportion and then somehow ignite.  

然而，要发生爆炸，气体需要以正确的比例与空气混合，然后以某种方式点燃。  

Simply shooting the tank very rarely provides the necessary spark to ignite the gas.  

仅仅射击罐体很少会产生点燃气体所需的火花。

### [Can a Penny Dropped from a Skyscraper Kill Someone?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NphZOIDZAf8)

If you dropped a penny from the top of a skyscraper, it actually wouldn't kill someone if it struck them.  

如果从摩天大楼顶端丢下一枚硬币，实际上即使砸到人也不会致命。  

This is because pennies are flat, causing them to have a slower terminal velocity.  

这是因为硬币是扁平的，导致它的终端速度较慢。  

If you reshaped the coin into a sharp needle-like object, it would pierce the air more efficiently, which would increase its speed as it fell.  

如果将硬币重新塑造成尖针状物体，它会更有效地穿透空气，从而增加下落速度。  

Once it reached the victim, it might hit with enough force to cause injury, but it still probably wouldn't kill them because it's not heavy enough.  

当它到达受害者时，可能会以足够的力量击中造成伤害，但仍然不太可能致命，因为它的重量不足。  

### [Reinforcing WWII Planes Based on Bullet Holes](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2b0CJYbwN_o)

Some of the planes that were shot in World War II actually survived, and engineers noticed that the bullet holes **clustered**(聚合/成群) in these specific areas.  

在二战中，一些被击中的飞机实际上幸存了下来，工程师们注意到弹孔集中在特定的区域。  

So they planned to reinforce those spots, assuming that those were the weakest points on the plane.  

因此，他们计划加固这些区域，假设它们是飞机上最薄弱的地方。  

But another engineer suggested that instead they should reinforce the areas without any bullet holes.  

但另一名工程师建议，他们应该加固那些没有弹孔的区域。  

He explained that the planes that were hit in these **unscathed**(未受伤的) areas were the ones that didn't return.  

他解释说，那些在未受损区域被击中的飞机是没有返航的飞机。  

Since the surviving planes weren't damaged there, it meant that those spots were likely the critical areas that needed the extra reinforcement.  

由于幸存的飞机在这些地方没有受损，这意味着这些地方可能是需要额外加固的关键区域。  

### [Can a Samurai Sword Slice a Bullet?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aTVitDNyjqQ)

当你去世后，你的遗体会被放入一个特别设计的炉子中，温度可以达到1800华氏度。  

The intense heat reduces the body to bone fragments and ashes within about 2 to 3 hours.  

高温会在大约2到3小时内将遗体化为骨灰和骨骸碎片。  

Afterward, a magnet is used to remove any metal objects like surgical pins, hidden piercings, and dental implants.  

随后使用磁铁移除金属物品，比如手术用的钢钉、隐藏的穿刺物和牙科植入物。  

Then the remaining bone fragments are processed into a fine powder, which is combined with the residual ash and placed in an **urn**(骨灰瓮/瓮/缸).  

然后将剩余的骨骸碎片加工成细粉，与骨灰混合后装入骨灰盒中。

### [Can an All-Powerful God Create a Rock He Can't Lift?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/P9CmLkNygPo)

Can an all-powerful God create a rock so heavy that even He can't lift it?  

全能的神是否能创造出一块连自己都无法举起的石头？  

If so, that means there's something God can't lift, which means God is not all-powerful.  

如果可以，那就意味着有某样东西神无法举起，这说明神不是全能的。  

If God can't create a rock that He can't lift, then that means He's not all-powerful because there's something He can't create.  

如果神不能创造出一块自己无法举起的石头，那也说明神不是全能的，因为存在一些他无法创造的东西。  

To truly be all-powerful, God would need to defy logic by creating a rock He can't lift but still be able to lift it.  

要真正做到全能，神需要违背逻辑，既创造出一块无法举起的石头，同时还能举起它。  

### [Why Is the McFlurry Spoon Hollow and Square?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hKSJVAU6JLk)

The McFlurry spoon is square and hollow because it's actually attached directly to this machine.  

McFlurry 的勺子是方形且中空的，因为它实际上直接连接到一台机器上。  

The cup with your ice cream and toppings is placed underneath as the spoon goes inside.  

盛有冰淇淋和配料的杯子会放在下面，勺子会插入其中。  

Then the machine spins the spoon like a drill as the cup is moved around.  

然后机器像钻头一样旋转勺子，同时移动杯子。  

This stirs the ingredients together to create the perfect signature mix.  

这会将配料搅拌均匀，制作出完美的招牌混合物。  

Once it's ready, the spoon is detached from the machine and served with your McFlurry.  

一旦完成，勺子会从机器上取下，随 McFlurry 一起递给顾客。  

### [How Party Snaps Work](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/V9hAegQwFmo)

When you throw a party snap, it hits a hard surface and creates friction.  

当你扔一个派对响炮时，它会撞击硬表面并产生摩擦。  

The small paper ball is filled with fine gravel and a tiny amount of silver **fulminate**(雷酸盐/爆炸).  

这个小纸球里面装有细小的碎石和少量的雷酸银。  

The friction generates a spark that ignites this silver fulminate, causing a mini explosion.  

摩擦会产生火花，引燃雷酸银，从而引发小型爆炸。  

Now, if these were the size of a baseball, they would contain much more of this explosive compound.  

如果这些响炮的大小和棒球一样，那么它们会包含更多的这种爆炸化合物。  

Theoretically, this would create a bigger explosion, but the reaction dynamics might change, potentially making it unpredictable.  

理论上这会产生更大的爆炸，但反应的动力学可能会发生变化，使结果变得不可预测。  

### [The Dangers of Butterfly Mines](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gPXRXpj57fs)

If you step on a butterfly mine, the soft wing-like structure compresses, triggering the mechanism inside.

而凸起的大小有助于确定过敏的可能性。

### [Deadly Vertical Logs in Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iFvbjT8xYqo)

When a tree falls into a river, one end sometimes absorbs more water, becoming heavier.  

当一棵树倒入河中时，一端有时会吸收更多的水，从而变得更重。  

Now, this forces the **waterlogged**(浸满水的) end to sink while the lighter end **pokes out**(突出) of the water.  

于是，这会让吸水的一端下沉，而较轻的一端露出水面。  

This vertical log bobs up and down and is barely visible.

### [The Gyro Train: A Balancing Wonder](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UwhX1601s1A)

This is a **gyro**(陀螺仪) train, and while it might look fake, it actually existed back in the 1800s.  

这是一个陀螺列车，虽然看起来像假的，但它确实存在于19世纪。  

Inside, massive spinning **gyroscopes**(陀螺仪) created angular momentum, which generated stability even when the train tilted.  

车内巨大的旋转陀螺仪产生了角动量，即使列车倾斜，它也能保持稳定。  

As the gyroscope spun, it allowed the train to maintain balance even on sharp curves.  

随着陀螺仪旋转，它使列车即使在急转弯时也能保持平衡。  

And although prototypes were built and tested, these trains were never widely adopted due to the complexity and high costs.  

尽管原型机被建造并测试过，但由于其复杂性和高昂成本，这种列车并未被广泛采用。

### [The Physics of Hollow Point Bullets](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wjU9yAvjQBc)

A hollow point bullet has an empty tip at the end.  

空尖弹的末端有一个空心尖。  

On impact, this cavity begins to expand as the bullet penetrates.  

在撞击时，这个空腔会随着子弹穿透而开始膨胀。  

The soft metal around the cavity flattens and mushrooms out.  

空腔周围的软金属会被压平并呈蘑菇状扩张。  

This expansion creates a larger wound hole, which means it maximizes the amount of damage.  

这种膨胀会造成更大的创口，这意味着它最大化了破坏力。  

The energy transfer also causes the bullet to slow down, which can stop it from passing through the target.  

能量的传递还会使子弹减速，从而阻止它穿透目标。  

### [The Anthrax Letters of 2001](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_9p-_tMlfjQ)

A man was covered in a white powder containing **anthrax**(炭疽) after opening a letter in 2001.

Biting through a bowling ball is something that a grizzly bear could easily do.  

咬穿一个保龄球是灰熊轻而易举的事情。  

This is because their wide, thick skull provides a stable anchor for the massive jaw muscles.  

这是因为它们宽厚的头骨为巨大的下颌肌肉提供了稳定的支撑点。  

These highly developed muscles generate the force needed to deliver such crushing bites—over 12,200 **lb**(libra磅) per square inch.  

这些高度发达的肌肉能够产生超过每平方英寸12,200磅的咬合力量。  

Additionally, their sharp, robust teeth can penetrate thick **hides**(兽皮) and tough materials.  

此外，它们锋利而结实的牙齿可以穿透厚皮和坚硬的材料。  

This incredible strength allows them to hunt large prey and access nutrient-rich bone **marrow**(骨髓/精华).

但这个地方实际上并不存在，而孩子们绿皮肤的原因至今未能解释。  

### [The Deadly Bamboo Traps of War](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_K4f9y4owAc)

The sharpened bamboo stakes were sometimes coated in **feces**(粪便).  

被削尖的竹签有时会涂上粪便。  

So soldiers not only faced the immediate pain of the puncture wound but also a high likelihood of severe infections.  

因此，士兵不仅会立即感受到穿刺伤的剧痛，还很可能受到严重感染。  

The sticks were often placed in camouflaged pits, where an unsuspecting soldier would accidentally step into them.  

竹签通常放在伪装的陷阱中，不知情的士兵会不小心踩进去。  

This would drive the sharp bamboo deep into their feet and legs.  

这会将锋利的竹签深深刺入他们的脚和腿部。  

Another tactic involved laying boards over a pit. As the boards snapped, the sticks would spring up, penetrating the soldier's leg.  

另一种战术是在陷阱上铺木板，当木板断裂时，竹签会弹起，刺入士兵的腿部。  

### [The Exploding Lava Lamp Incident](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Y7HisAnSRI8)

**Turbulence**(湍流/骚乱) can be dangerous if you aren't wearing your seatbelt.  

如果你不系安全带，湍流可能会非常危险。  

It happens when there's a sudden change in the wind speed *above and below the plane*.  

湍流发生在飞机上下方的风速突然改变时。  

This causes it to **bump**(颠簸行进/碰/撞/肿块) and shake.  

这会导致飞机颠簸和摇晃。  

Normally, airplanes fly smoothly when the wind's speed and direction remain consistent.  

通常，当风速和方向保持一致时，飞机会平稳飞行。  

And while it's almost unheard of for turbulence to actually cause a plane to crash, it can still be very dangerous for people inside the cabin.  

尽管湍流导致飞机坠毁的情况几乎闻所未闻，但对机舱内的乘客来说仍然非常危险。  

### [The Tragic Story of a Sperm Whale Attacking a Ship](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/F-bT-Rr76e8)

### [The Tarantula Hawk Wasp's Horrifying Hunting Tactic](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kK_3DvLztKY)

A **tarantula**(狼蛛) hawk **wasp**(黄蜂) uses its powerful stinger to deliver a **paralyzing**(麻痹) venom to its prey.  

狼蛛蜂用它强大的毒刺向猎物注入麻痹性毒液。  

The venom is so potent that it instantly immobilizes the tarantula.  

这种毒液非常强效，可以瞬间让狼蛛失去行动能力。  

Then the wasp drags the paralyzed spider to a burrow.  

然后，狼蛛蜂会将瘫痪的蜘蛛拖到地洞中。  

There, it lays a single egg on the spider's abdomen.  

它会在蜘蛛的腹部产下一枚卵。  

As the egg hatches, the wasp larvae begin to feed on the still-living tarantula.  

当卵孵化后，蜂幼虫会开始啃食仍然活着的狼蛛。  

It avoids vital organs to keep the spider alive as long as possible, ensuring fresh food.  

它会避开重要器官，以尽可能保持蜘蛛的生命，为其提供新鲜食物。  

Eventually, the larvae emerge as an adult, leaving the spider's husk behind.

### [Why Train Wheels Are Shaped Like a Cone](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Cyp0NlPyVT0)

If train wheels were like normal wheels, the wheel would just slip off the track at every turn.  

如果火车轮子像普通轮子一样，轮子在每次转弯时都会滑出轨道。  

Instead, the train's wheels are actually shaped like a cone.  

然而，火车的轮子实际上是锥形的。  

The wheel's **tread**(胎面/踩/踏)—the flat part—makes contact with the rail and supports the train's weight.  

轮子的踏面（平坦部分）与轨道接触，支撑着火车的重量。  

This conical shape allows the wheels to adjust their position on the track.  

这种锥形设计使轮子能够调整在轨道上的位置。  

When the train moves through a curve, the wheels shift slightly, with one side moving up the cone and the other side moving down.  

当火车转弯时，轮子会略微移动，一侧向锥体上方移动，而另一侧向下移动。  

This allows one side to move faster than the other, ensuring smooth navigation through curves.  

这样一侧的速度会比另一侧快，从而确保顺利通过弯道。

### [Can a World War II Helmet Stop a Bullet?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jXsk0Akc3Tw)

If you shot at a World War II helmet, most people think it would stop the bullet.

But these helmets were made of steel and were designed to protect against shrapnel and debris.  

但这些头盔是用钢制成的，设计目的是防止弹片和碎片伤害。  

Now, if the bullet was shot at a certain angle, the helmet could deflect it under the right circumstances.  

如果子弹以某个角度射击，在特定条件下头盔可以将其弹开。  

However, direct hits would almost always just go right through.  

然而，直接命中几乎总是会穿透头盔。

### [How Cluster Bombs Work](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lpWC6K2wTy4)

When a cluster bomb is dropped, it releases a **casing**(包装/套/盒) filled with smaller bomblets.  

当集束炸弹被投下时，它会释放出一个装满小型炸弹的外壳。  

As it descends, the casing opens midair, dispersing these bomblets over a wide area.  

在下降过程中，外壳在空中打开，将这些小型炸弹分散到广泛的区域。  

Each one is equipped with its own fuse and explosive charge.  

每枚炸弹都有自己的引信和炸药。  

Upon hitting the ground, most of them detonate, causing multiple explosions over a large radius.  

当落地时，大多数炸弹会爆炸，在大范围内引发多次爆炸。  

But not all of them will go off immediately, leaving a large area of live explosives.  

但并非所有炸弹都会立即爆炸，留下大片未引爆的炸弹区域。  

### [How to Handle Hydroplaning While Driving](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Vk6x8mWBUhw)

Hydroplaning happens when your car's tires lose contact with the road because of water.  

当汽车轮胎因水而失去与路面的接触时，就会发生水滑现象。  

Some people might panic during this, slamming on the brakes, but this can actually make things worse.  

有些人在这种情况下可能会惊慌失措，猛踩刹车，但这实际上会让情况变得更糟。  

Instead, you should ease off the accelerator to gradually slow down and don't brake at all if you can help it.  

相反，你应该松开油门，逐渐减速，如果可以，尽量不要刹车。  

Keep the steering wheel steady and do your best to wait until you feel the tires grip the road again.  

保持方向盘稳定，尽量等待直到你感觉轮胎重新抓住地面。  

### [What Happens When You Use a Flashbang?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MR5F2wafYEA)

When you pull the pin on a flashbang, it activates a fuse which ignites a small **charge**(炸药量) inside the device.  

当你拔掉闪光弹的拉环时，它会启动一个引信，引爆装置内的小型炸药。  

Within seconds, the flashbang explodes, producing a blinding flash of light and a deafening bang.  

几秒钟内，闪光弹爆炸，产生刺眼的强光和震耳欲聋的巨响。  

This light is so bright that it temporarily overwhelms the eyes' photoreceptors, causing temporary blindness.  

这种光亮极其刺眼，会暂时压制眼睛的光感受器，导致短暂失明。  

At the same time, the bang, reaching up to 180 dB, overwhelms the enemy's ears.  

与此同时，高达180分贝的巨响会压制敌人的听力。

### [The Massive Heart of a Blue Whale](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uMxR4rB4X14)

If you somehow took the heart out of a blue whale, it would weigh around 400 lb and would be the size of a small car.  

如果你设法取出蓝鲸的心脏，它大约重400磅，大小相当于一辆小汽车。  

Now, this organ is so massive because it has to pump out over 60 gallons of blood throughout the entire whale every time it beats.  

这个器官之所以如此巨大，是因为它每次跳动都要泵出超过60加仑的血液，流遍整个蓝鲸的身体。  

And this takes such a large amount of energy that the heart only beats about eight times per minute while submerged.  

这需要消耗大量能量，因此当蓝鲸潜水时，心脏每分钟仅跳动约8次。  

### [The Great Escape from Alcatraz](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/I2LEBHDCnSc)

Three prisoners used spoons to dig through the walls of their Alcatraz cell in 1962.

如果你一个人被噎住了，立即拨打911，并保持电话线路畅通，同时努力用力咳嗽以排出异物。  

If that doesn't work, make a fist with one hand, place it above your navel, hold it in place with your other hand, and thrust inward then upward in a J-shaped motion.  

如果这样不起作用，握紧一只拳头，将其放在肚脐上方，用另一只手固定住，然后用J形的动作向内再向上推压。  

But if you need more force, lean over a hard surface and press your abdomen against it while keeping your fist in place.  

如果需要更大的力度，弯腰靠在硬表面上，同时保持拳头位置，用力压迫腹部。  

Use sharp, quick thrusts to try to dislodge the object and keep trying these techniques until help arrives.  

使用快速有力的推压尝试排出异物，并持续使用这些方法直到救援到来。  

### [The Oddities of Teratoma Tumors](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Q4hEXT2Y5YQ)

You might find hair, teeth, and even an eye if you cut open a **teratoma**(畸胎瘤) tumor.  

如果你切开一个畸胎瘤，可能会发现头发、牙齿，甚至是眼睛。  

These tumors form when germ cells grow abnormally in the womb.  

这些肿瘤是在胚胎细胞在子宫内异常生长时形成的。  

And these cells have the potential to develop into any tissue in the body.  

这些细胞具有发育成身体任何组织的潜力。  

Sometimes these cells **clump**(形成一丛/丛) together and start forming different body parts within a single tumor.  

有时，这些细胞会聚集在一起，并在一个肿瘤中开始形成不同的身体部位。  

Now, while odd, these tumors are usually harmless.  

尽管看起来奇怪，这些肿瘤通常是无害的。  

### [The Bullet That Couldn't Stop Roosevelt's Speech](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YsjqPWKCIoI)

Now, the bullet struck him in a lethal spot, but he somehow remained standing.  

子弹击中了他的致命部位，但他却奇迹般地站着没倒。  

So, how was this possible? Well, Roosevelt had a thick, folded-up speech in his coat pocket along with a metal glasses case.  

这是怎么可能的呢？原来，罗斯福在外套口袋里装着一份厚厚的折叠讲稿和一个金属眼镜盒。  

And the bullet hit these items, which slowed it down and protected his lungs.  

子弹击中了这些物品，使其减速并保护了他的肺部。  

Now, despite the injury, he insisted on finishing his 90-minute speech.  

尽管受了伤，他还是坚持完成了90分钟的演讲。

### [The Journey of a Whale Carcass](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vwefrGbBV78)

When a whale dies, their massive body floats on the surface because of trapped gases inside.  

当鲸鱼死亡时，它庞大的身体会因为体内的气体而漂浮在水面上。  

This attracts scavengers like sharks that quickly eat the blubber and muscle, allowing the gas to slowly escape.  

这会吸引像鲨鱼这样的食腐动物迅速吃掉鲸鱼的脂肪和肌肉，让气体慢慢释放出来。  

This makes the carcass heavier and causes it to sink to the ocean floor.  

这样使得尸体更重，最终沉入海底。  

There, crustaceans and mollusks feed on the remaining material until only a skeleton remains.  

在海底，甲壳类动物和软体动物会吃掉剩余的组织，直到只剩下骨骼。  

Then, bone-eating worms begin to break down the whale skeleton over decades.  

然后，嗜骨虫会在几十年内分解鲸鱼的骨骼。  

### [How Much Blood Can a Mosquito Drink?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Qf2f5lVRtaU)

A mosquito **shoves**(猛推) its needle-like mouth into your skin and starts drinking your blood.  

蚊子用针状的口器刺入你的皮肤，开始吸血。  

Now, a single mosquito can only drink up to 0.1 ml at a time, and the average human has about 5 L of blood in their body at any moment.  

一只蚊子一次只能吸约0.1毫升血，而普通人体内平均有约5升血液。  

This means that it would take approximately 500,000 mosquitoes all drinking your blood at the same time to drain your body dry.  

这意味着需要大约50万只蚊子同时吸血，才能将你的身体吸干。  

### [How Astronauts Poop in Space](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/R9aHi3m0wY4)

When astronauts poop in space, they use a special toilet that uses airflow rather than water.  

当宇航员在太空中排便时，他们使用的是一种依靠气流而不是水的特殊厕所。  

First, they **position**(安置/使处于) themselves carefully over the small opening and use **tow**(拖/牵引) straps to hold them in place.  

首先，他们小心地对准小开口，并用绑带固定自己。  

The airflow sucks their poop into a storage container while a separate vacuum system collects their pee.  

气流会将排泄物吸入存储容器，同时另一个真空系统收集尿液。  

Then, the poop is vacuum-sealed and stored for disposal until it can be burned up when entering the atmosphere.  

然后，排泄物会被真空密封并存储起来，直到进入大气层时被烧毁。  

### [How Vein Finders Work](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CAF7YMcaFQw)

Big veins are usually easier to penetrate if you need an IV, but small or hidden veins can be tricky, which can cause pain and bruising as they try to hit it.  

如果需要静脉注射，大的静脉通常更容易穿刺，但小的或隐藏的静脉会很难找到，这可能导致疼痛和淤青。  

To help, doctors use a special device called a vein finder.  

为了解决这个问题，医生会使用一种叫做静脉探测仪的特殊设备。  

This device uses infrared light that gets absorbed by the blood inside the veins.  

这种设备利用红外光，红外光会被静脉内的血液吸收。  

It will detect the veins and project the image onto the skin, making them appear as dark lines.  

它可以探测到静脉，并将图像投射到皮肤上，使静脉显示为深色线条。  

Then, they just need to pick the vein they want and insert the needle.  

然后，医生只需要选择目标静脉并插入针头即可。  

### [What Happens During a Bolus Injection](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OqodD3msmCw)

A needle pierces through your skin and into a vein when you get a **bolus injection**(推注).  

当你接受推注式注射时，针头会刺入皮肤并进入静脉。  

As the medicine is injected, it flows straight into your bloodstream.  

药物注入后，会直接流入血液。  

Then, it rapidly begins to circulate the medication throughout your body.  

随后，药物会迅速在体内循环。  

This ensures that it reaches the affected areas in a short period of time.  

这样可以确保药物在短时间内抵达受影响的部位。  

Then, the needle is removed as the hole in your vein begins to heal.  

最后，针头被拔出，静脉上的针孔开始愈合。

### [What Happens If You Throw a Firecracker in a Toilet?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/w0iRnyMyiQQ)

If you throw a firecracker down a toilet, the fuse will often stay lit if it's burned down the wick far enough.  

如果你将鞭炮扔进马桶里，只要导火索烧得足够短，它通常会继续燃烧。  

Because it's in a confined space and underwater, when the firecracker finally goes off, the ceramic material of the toilet can't actually withstand this sudden pressure.  

由于鞭炮处于密闭空间且在水下，当它最终爆炸时，马桶的陶瓷材料无法承受这种突然的压力。  

As a result, the material can shatter, and in most instances, it can ruin the toilet beyond repair.  

因此，陶瓷会碎裂，在大多数情况下会导致马桶无法修复。  

### [New York City's Horse Poop Crisis in the 1800s](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nojxwtzCN4g)

New York City streets were covered in horse poop in the late 1800s.  

19世纪末的纽约街道上满是马粪。  

With thousands of horses pulling on the streets every day, the city struggled to manage the massive amounts of waste.  

每天有成千上万匹马在街道上奔跑，城市难以处理这些巨量的排泄物。  

The stench and unsanitary conditions were unbearable.  

恶臭和不卫生的环境令人难以忍受。  

The poop also attracted flies and rats, creating further health hazards.  

马粪还吸引了苍蝇和老鼠，进一步造成健康威胁。  

They tried to impose regulations to control the problem, but it wasn't really fixed until automobiles started replacing horses.  

人们试图通过法规来控制这个问题，但直到汽车开始取代马匹后，这个问题才真正得以解决。  

### [Why Stepping on a Rusty Nail Can Be Dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DBeHmTAMLYA)

If you step on an old, dirty nail, the sharp metal punctures your skin and can insert a type of bacteria into your body.  

如果你踩到一根又旧又脏的钉子，锋利的金属会刺破你的皮肤，并可能将一种细菌带入体内。  

Once inside, the bacteria releases a toxin.  

细菌进入体内后会释放毒素。  

Eventually, the area around the wound will begin to **stiffen**(变僵硬).  

最终，伤口周围的区域会开始变硬。  

If left untreated, this toxin will cause severe muscle contractions.  

如果不加治疗，毒素会导致严重的肌肉收缩。  

If it reaches your face, it can cause your jaw muscles to contract uncontrollably, making it almost impossible to open your mouth.  

如果毒素到达面部，它会导致你的下颌肌肉无法控制地收缩，使你几乎无法张开嘴巴。  

To prevent the spread, get the proper injections within 48 hours, which could neutralize the toxin.  

为了防止毒素扩散，请在48小时内注射适当的药物，这可以中和毒素。  

### [A Rare Bacterial Infection from Dog Saliva](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/e0KCbT-G2Uo)

A dog licked a small scrape on a woman in 2018, and after several hours, she was rushed to the hospital with severe symptoms.  

2018年，一只狗舔了一个女人身上的小擦伤，几小时后她因严重症状被紧急送往医院。  

Doctors discovered she had **contracted**(感染) a rare bacterial infection from the dog saliva through the small wound on her skin.  

医生发现，她通过皮肤上的小伤口，从狗的唾液中感染了一种罕见的细菌感染。  

This infection quickly spread, causing her limbs to turn black and slowly die.  

这种感染迅速扩散，导致她的四肢变黑并逐渐坏死。  

Doctors had no choice but to amputate her hands and legs to stop the infection and save her life.  

医生别无选择，只能截肢以阻止感染并挽救她的生命。  

### [How Cork Seals Work on Bottles](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UvmOOvMN9l8)

When a bottle is fixed with a cork, you might think that it's completely sealed, but the porous structure actually allows a minuscule amount of air to interact with the liquid inside.  

当瓶子用软木塞封住时，你可能认为它是完全密封的，但软木的多孔结构实际上允许少量空气与瓶内的液体接触。  

This interaction is especially important for some wines, where tiny amounts of oxygen help develop flavors over time.  

这种交互对某些葡萄酒尤为重要，少量氧气可以随着时间的推移帮助发展风味。  

The cork's natural elasticity allows it to expand and contract, maintaining the seal evenly as temperatures fluctuate.  

软木的天然弹性使其能够膨胀和收缩，在温度变化时保持均匀的密封性。

### [How an RPG Works](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RIkbKpw-5e4)

Pulling the trigger ignites a primer.  

扣动扳机会点燃底火。  

When you fire an RPG, this primer then lights a propellant charge in the launcher tube, which forces the grenade out.  

当你发射RPG时，底火会点燃发射管中的推进药，从而将榴弹推出发射管。  

The grenade has a rocket motor that ignites after a safe distance, providing additional thrust as it flies.  

榴弹配有火箭发动机，在达到安全距离后点燃，为飞行提供额外推力。  

Stabilizing **fins**(尾翼/鱼鳍) deploy, keeping the grenade on course.  

稳定翼展开，使榴弹保持飞行轨迹。  

Upon impact, the grenade nose cone collapses, triggering a detonator.  

碰撞时，榴弹的弹头部分会塌陷，从而引爆引信。  

This ignites the main explosive charge inside the grenade, sending out a powerful blast.  

引信会点燃榴弹内部的主炸药，释放出强大的爆炸冲击波。  

### [The Exploding Whale in Taiwan](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0E7gSVBW31g)

A 60-ton dead whale was loaded onto a flatbed truck in Taiwan.  

一头60吨重的死鲸被装载到台湾的一辆平板卡车上。  

But as it traveled through the crowded streets, gases built up inside the decomposing carcass.  

然而，在穿越拥挤街道时，腐烂尸体内部的气体开始积聚。  

Eventually, the pressure from these gases became too strong, causing it to burst.  

最终，这些气体的压力变得过大，导致鲸鱼爆炸。  

The blast sent blood, organs, and blubber flying through the streets.  

爆炸将血液、内脏和脂肪炸飞到街道上。  

It covered cars, shops, and bystanders in a gruesome, smelly mess.  

污秽的血肉覆盖了车辆、商铺和路人，令人触目惊心且气味难闻。  

### [How to Survive Closing Walls](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qmjySqVLtCc)

If you find yourself in a room with walls closing in, most people will immediately begin to panic.  

如果你发现自己在一个墙壁不断靠近的房间里，大多数人会立刻开始惊慌失措。  

But this wastes time and energy.  

但这会浪费时间和精力。  

Instead, look for any mechanism or button that might stop the walls.  

相反，你应该寻找任何可能停止墙壁运动的装置或按钮。  

If you can't find one, use any available objects to wedge between where the walls are moving, providing more resistance to slow them down.  

如果找不到按钮，使用任何可用物体插入墙壁之间，为它们的运动增加阻力，从而减缓速度。  

If that fails, try climbing up and find a space above the moving walls where you can escape the crushing force.  

如果这也无效，尝试向上攀爬，找一个移动墙壁上方的空间，以躲避压迫力。  

### [Man Dissolved in Yellowstone Hot Spring](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XgqNtYf59-8)

A man fell into a hot spring at Yellowstone Park in 2016.  

2016年，一名男子掉入黄石公园的一个温泉中。  

The extremely hot water caused severe burns as soon as he fell in.  

极高温的泉水在他落水时立即造成了严重的烧伤。  

But the water also contains acid, which immediately began to eat away at his skin.  

然而，这些泉水还含有酸性物质，迅速开始腐蚀他的皮肤。  

After 5 minutes, the heat would have caused him to go into shock.  

五分钟后，高温会导致他进入休克状态。  

When he was found later that day, he was pronounced dead, but the water was still too hot to reach him.  

当天稍晚些时候，人们发现了他的尸体，但泉水仍然太烫，无法将他打捞上来。  

By this point, the acid and heat had completely caused his body to dissolve, leaving nothing but his wallet and shoes.  

此时，酸性物质和高温已经将他的身体完全溶解，只剩下钱包和鞋子。  

### [Could We Build a Space Elevator?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JY11V32G0kQ)

If we built a massive elevator stretching all the way to space, Earth's gravity would hold the base in place, just like a skyscraper.  

如果我们建造了一部直达太空的大型电梯，地球的重力会像固定摩天大楼一样将它的底部稳稳地固定住。  

That is, until it reaches extreme heights.  

但当它达到极高的高度时，情况会发生变化。  

At this point, it would become too heavy, making the structure unstable.  

在这个高度，电梯会变得过于沉重，导致结构不稳定。  

But what if we kept building?  

但是，如果我们继续建造呢？  

Once it reaches a staggering 22,000 miles high, Earth's gravity loses to the **centrifugal force** from space.  

当它达到惊人的22,000英里高时，地球的重力将不敌太空中的离心力。  

By putting a large counterweight at the top, this new force would begin to pull the tower outward.  

在顶部安装一个巨大的配重块后，这种新的力量会开始将塔向外拉。  

In theory, this tension would keep the elevator steady, allowing safe travel **to and from**(往返) space.  

理论上，这种张力会使电梯保持稳定，从而实现安全的太空往返旅行。

### [The Danger of Internal Decapitation](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0V2wHOZvPPA)

The sudden impact in a severe car crash can cause your head to snap backwards violently.  

严重车祸中的突然撞击会导致你的头猛烈向后甩动。  

This violent motion stretches and tears the ligaments and muscles that connect the skull to the neck.  

这种剧烈的运动会拉伸并撕裂连接头骨和颈部的韧带和肌肉。  

And this separation can damage the spinal cord, resulting in an internal decapitation.  

这种分离可能会损伤脊髓，从而导致“内部分离性断头”。  

When the skull can sometimes separate from the spine without breaking the skin.  

在某些情况下，头骨可能会与脊柱分离，但皮肤却不会破裂。  

If treated immediately, survival is sometimes possible with surgical intervention.  

如果立即接受治疗，借助外科手术，生还有时是可能的。  

### [The Tongue-Eating Parasite](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MdmEgVFtMlI)

The parasite enters through the gills and clamps onto the fish's tongue with sharp, strong claws.  

这种寄生虫从鱼鳃进入，并用尖锐而有力的爪子夹住鱼的舌头。  

It then **severs**(切断) the blood vessels in the tongue, stopping blood flow, which causes it to die and eventually fall off.  

它随后切断舌头中的血管，阻止血液流动，从而导致舌头死亡并最终脱落。  

Once the tongue is gone, the parasite attaches itself to the remaining stub, becoming the fish's new tongue.  

当舌头消失后，寄生虫会附着在剩下的根部，变成鱼的新舌头。  

As the fish eats, the parasite gets a share of the food.  

当鱼进食时，寄生虫也会分得一部分食物。  

And this creepy thing stays there, living on the fish and acting as its tongue until the host dies.  

这种可怕的生物会一直待在那里，依靠鱼的身体存活，并充当它的舌头，直到宿主死亡。  

### [How G-Forces Cause Blackouts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/l7aoth4L-hA)

Extreme acceleration forces the blood in your body to move away from your brain.  

极端加速度会导致你体内的血液远离大脑。  

When you're on a slingshot ride, with less blood in the brain, the supply of oxygen is diminished.  

当你乘坐弹射式过山车时，大脑中的血液减少，氧气供应也随之减少。  

This can cause you to start to feel **light-headed**(头晕的) and dizzy.  

这可能会让你感到头晕目眩。  

And if the force is strong enough, it can actually trigger a brief loss of consciousness.  

如果加速度足够强，实际上可能会引发短暂的意识丧失。  

Once the ride slows down, blood returns to your brain, and you'll quickly regain consciousness.  

当游乐设施减速后，血液会回流到大脑，你会迅速恢复意识。  

### [How to Safely Handle Being Stuck in an Elevator](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0e4n7I_83CU)

If you're stuck in an elevator, most people would try to pry the doors open.  

如果你被困在电梯里，大多数人会试图撬开电梯门。  

But this can be dangerous since the elevator might start moving again as you're exiting.  

但这可能很危险，因为在你试图逃出时，电梯可能会再次启动。  

And if you try to crawl out of the ceiling **hatch**(舱口/开口/孵化), you might get caught in the machinery and fall down the shaft.  

如果你试图从天花板的通道爬出去，你可能会被机械设备夹住并掉入电梯井。  

Instead, just press the emergency button and watch Zach D Films while you wait to be rescued.  

相反，只需按下紧急按钮，然后在等待救援时观看 Zach D Films 就可以了。  

### [How a Nail Gun Works](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3jSeUsOMO3Q)

When you press a nail gun against a surface, a safety mechanism **disengages**(脱离), allowing the trigger to be activated.  

当你将钉枪压在表面上时，一个安全机制会解除，使扳机可以被激活。  

Pulling the trigger releases a burst of compressed air, and this energy pushes a piston forward at high speed.  

扣动扳机会释放出一股压缩空气，这种能量会推动活塞以高速向前移动。  

Driving the nail out of the gun, the nail is forced through a narrow nozzle, guiding it precisely into the material.  

钉子会被从钉枪中推出，并通过一个狭窄的喷嘴被强行钉入材料中，位置精确无误。  

After each shot, the piston **retracts**(缩回), and a new nail moves into position from the magazine.  

每次射钉后，活塞会回缩，新的钉子会从弹匣中移动到位。

### [How Money Counters Work](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KG6pxno-jDo)

A money counter uses friction rollers to pull each bill individually.  

点钞机使用摩擦滚筒逐张拉出钞票。  

These rollers grip one bill at a time, ensuring they move one by one into the machine.  

这些滚筒一次抓住一张钞票，确保它们逐张进入机器。  

The separated bills then pass through a scanning mechanism with light sensors that detect and count each bill.  

分离的钞票随后通过带有光传感器的扫描机制，检测并计数每张钞票。  

The sensors also check for size and security features to verify authenticity.  

传感器还会检查钞票的大小和安全特征，以验证其真伪。  

This precise one-by-one handling ensures accurate counting and prevents jams during the process.  

这种逐张精确处理确保了计数的准确性，并防止在过程中发生卡钞。  

### [Can You Swallow Upside Down?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bYCcB2FrsHE)

If you try to swallow upside down, you might think the food would get stuck or even fall back into your mouth.  

如果你试图倒着吞咽，你可能会认为食物会卡住，甚至会掉回嘴里。  

But that's not actually true.  

但事实并非如此。  

You see, gravity isn't actually what makes the food go down.  

你知道吗？实际上让食物下咽的并不是重力。  

Instead, you have several different muscles lining your throat.  

相反，衬在你喉咙里的几组肌肉才是关键。  

When you swallow, these muscles contract in a coordinated sequence, pushing the food down your **esophagus**(食管/ɪˈsɑːfəɡəs/).  

当你吞咽时，这些肌肉会协调收缩，将食物推入食管中。  

And this is what allows you to swallow upside down.  

这就是为什么你可以倒着吞咽的原因。  

### [Why Catching an Arrow Is Nearly Impossible](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5dOyYTuvYq0)

If someone shot an arrow at you, some people think you could actually catch it.  

如果有人向你射箭，有些人认为你可以抓住它。  

But an arrow travels at up to 200 mph, as fast as a bullet train.  

然而，箭的速度可高达每小时200英里，与子弹列车一样快。  

If it was shot from 25 ft away, you'd only have an eighth of a second to catch it.  

如果从25英尺外射出，你只有八分之一秒的时间去抓住它。  

Now, for most people, it takes twice that long for the brain to send signals to the hand.  

而对于大多数人来说，大脑向手发送信号所需的时间是这个时间的两倍。  

Meaning catching an arrow is practically impossible for most people.  

这意味着对于大多数人来说，抓住一支箭几乎是不可能的。  

### [How to Survive a Bee Attack](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jZOyaXfCQ6Q)

If you're attacked by a swarm of bees, most people would jump into water to try and escape them.  

如果你被一群蜜蜂袭击，大多数人会跳入水中试图逃脱。  

But the bees will just wait for you to resurface before attacking again.  

但蜜蜂会等你浮出水面后再次袭击。  

Instead, you should cover your face with your shirt to protect your eyes and mouth.  

相反，你应该用衣服遮住脸部，以保护眼睛和嘴巴。  

Run as fast as you can to escape the swarm, aiming for a shelter like a car.  

尽可能快地跑开以逃离蜂群，目标是找到像汽车这样的庇护所。  

Once inside, remove any stingers to prevent further venom release.  

进入庇护所后，移除所有蜂刺以防止进一步的毒液释放。  

### [The Dung Beetle's Rolling Technique](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pqKy2zqsk4E)

A dung beetle will carve out a chunk of poop and begin shaping it into a ball.  

蜣螂会挖出一块粪便，并开始将其塑造成一个球。  

First, it uses its strong front legs to pat and press the poop into a rounder shape.  

首先，它用强壮的前腿拍打并按压粪便，使其变得更圆。  

Then it smooths the surface with its back legs, making sure the ball is even.  

然后，它用后腿抚平表面，确保球体均匀。  

As it's rolled away, it keeps smoothing and shaping the ball, ensuring it stays perfectly round.  

在滚动的过程中，它不断抚平和塑形，确保球体保持完美的圆形。  

Finally, the beetle buries it and lays its eggs inside.  

最后，蜣螂将球埋起来，并在其中产卵。

### [Can a Police Badge Stop a Bullet?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WSgnaM-6Z6I)

If you shot a police badge, you might think the bullet would ricochet off.  

如果你射击一枚警徽，你可能会认为子弹会弹开。  

But silver and gold badges are soft enough to bend with your hands, meaning they have no chance of saving the officer's life.  

但银质和金质警徽柔软到可以用手弯曲，这意味着它们根本无法救警官的命。  

A brass badge is harder and would slow down the bullet, but it would still go right through.  

黄铜警徽更硬一些，可以减缓子弹速度，但子弹仍然会穿透过去。  

Only nickel and steel badges are hard enough to even have a tiny chance of deflecting a bullet.  

只有镍制和钢制警徽足够坚硬，才有一丁点可能偏转子弹。  

### [How Your Body Reacts to a Hot Stove](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/l8aO5shP7o0)

When you touch a hot stove, energy from the heat is rapidly transferred to your skin.  

当你触碰到热炉时，热量的能量会迅速传递到你的皮肤。  

Then specialized nerve endings detect the extreme temperature change and send a message to your brain within fractions of a second.  

然后，特化的神经末梢会检测到极端温度变化，并在几分之一秒内将信息传递到大脑。  

These nerve signals travel through the spinal cord and up to your brain stem, completely bypassing your conscious thought.  

这些神经信号通过脊髓传递到脑干，完全绕过你的意识思维。  

Inside the brain, the signals directly activate **motor functions**(运动功能), causing the muscles in your hand to contract.  

在大脑中，这些信号会直接激活运动功能，导致手部肌肉收缩。  

And this rapid contraction pulls your hand away from the stove involuntarily.  

这种快速收缩会让你的手不由自主地从炉子上移开。  

### [Tallest vs Smallest: Humans, Cars, and Ships](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ufPFLu-xc-4)

This is the tallest human versus the smallest human to ever live.  

这是有史以来最高的人类与最矮的人类的对比。  

The smallest human would need to be stacked over five times to reach this height.  

最矮的人类需要叠加超过五个高度才能达到这样的高度。  

And for cars, the longest is over 100 ft, while the smallest is just 4.5 ft, meaning you would need 22 lined up to match the length.  

对于汽车来说，最长的超过100英尺，而最短的只有4.5英尺，这意味着需要22辆排成一排才能匹配长度。  

The smallest ship in the world is just over 11 ft long, and you would need 137 of them to reach the length of the **Seawise**(受过航海锻炼的) Giant, the longest ship in the world.  

世界上最小的船仅有11英尺多长，而你需要137艘这样的船才能达到世界上最长的船“海上巨人”的长度。  

And if you took the largest dinosaur that ever existed, you would need around 40 of the smallest lined up to be the same length.  

如果你拿有史以来最大的恐龙来比较，则需要大约40只最小的恐龙排成一排才能达到同样的长度。  

### [The Chilling Story of a Man Trapped Behind a Refrigerator](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tvhGkYiTB80)

A man fell behind a large refrigerator unit at the supermarket where he worked in 2009.  

2009年，一名男子跌落到他工作的超市的大型冷藏装置后面。  

Now, he was seriously trapped, but his cries for help were drowned out by the noise of the coolers.  

他被严重困住了，但他的呼救声被冷藏机的噪音淹没了。  

Days passed, and weeks turned into months with no leads on his whereabouts.  

日子一天天过去，几周变成了几个月，仍然没有他的下落线索。  

It was 10 years later that **contractors**(承包商) began working on the now-abandoned supermarket.  

10年后，承包商开始对现已废弃的超市进行施工。  

As they moved the refrigerator unit, they found the man's remains wedged behind it.

### [How to Escape a House Fire](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TciQ1iOKBkA)

If you're trapped in a house fire, you should drop to the floor to avoid inhaling toxic smoke.  

如果你被困在房屋火灾中，你应该趴到地板上以避免吸入有毒烟雾。  

To escape, check if the door is hot with the back of your hand and look for smoke coming through the cracks.  

为了逃生，用手背检查门是否热，并观察是否有烟雾从缝隙中冒出来。  

If there's a fire behind the door, opening it will only make it spread.  

如果门后有火，打开它只会让火势蔓延。  

Instead, find a window. If you can't open it, smash it and lay a blanket over the broken glass to escape.  

相反，寻找窗户。如果打不开，就打碎它，并在破碎的玻璃上盖一条毯子以逃生。  

But if the door is cool and there's no smoke, open it slowly and close it behind you to prevent the fire from spreading.  

但如果门是凉的，并且没有烟雾，慢慢打开它并在身后关上门，以防止火势蔓延。

### [Could We Raise the Titanic?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/r6FmKDVKm5k)

If we attached a huge magnet to the Titanic, we could try to pull it up.  

如果我们在泰坦尼克号上安装一个巨大的磁铁，我们可以试着将它拉起来。  

But the metal is so degraded that this would just tear the ship apart.  

但金属已经严重腐蚀，这样做只会把船撕裂。  

Filling the ship with ping-pong balls could theoretically float it up, but the water pressure would instantly crush them before anything could happen.  

将船填满乒乓球理论上可以让它浮起来，但水压会瞬间将它们压碎，什么都做不了。  

A giant 10-ton hook could also work if it were attached to a huge robot submarine, but this would also most likely just damage the ship.  

如果用一个巨大的10吨钩子连到一个大型机器人潜艇上，也可能奏效，但这很可能也会损坏船体。 

### [What Does It Mean to Be Double-Jointed?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OfPmQAPCD6E)

If you're double-jointed, some people think it means that you actually have two joints.  

如果你是双关节，一些人会认为这意味着你实际上有两个关节。  

But that's not actually how it works.  

但事实并非如此。  

You see, normally joints move within a **set**(固定的) range, limited by **ligaments**(韧带/ˈlɪɡəmənt/) and **tendons**(肌腱/ˈtendən/) that stabilize them.  

通常，关节的活动范围是固定的，由韧带和肌腱稳定它们。  

But in a double-jointed person, these ligaments and tendons are looser, making them more flexible.  

但在双关节的人身上，这些韧带和肌腱更松弛，使他们更灵活。  

And this extra flexibility allows them to bend their joints further than normal.  

这种额外的灵活性使他们的关节能够弯曲得比普通人更远。  

### [How to Survive an Alligator's Death Roll](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jYszrSLXLvo)

If an alligator grabs you, it might start a death roll, a terrifying spin meant to dismember prey.

To survive, you should try to roll in the same direction as the alligator.  

为了生存，你应该尝试与鳄鱼朝同一个方向翻滚。  

If you have a free arm, aim for the alligator's eyes or try to **jab**(刺/戳) its nostrils.  

如果你有一只手能自由活动，瞄准鳄鱼的眼睛或尝试戳它的鼻孔。  

And if all else fails, play dead. Sometimes the alligator will release its grip, giving you a chance to escape.  

如果一切都失败了，就装死。有时候鳄鱼会松开它的咬合力，给你一个逃生的机会。  

### [The Tragic Story of a Teen Who Ate a Live Slug](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2gSKVbL1N3g)

A teenager ate a live **slug**(蛞蝓) on a **dare**(激将) with his friends in 2010.

第二天，他感到头晕、恶心，并且腿部有奇怪的疼痛感。  

Doctors discovered that he had contracted a rare parasite.  

医生发现他感染了一种罕见的寄生虫。  

There was no treatment, and usually, the body would just get rid of it by itself.  

没有治疗方法，通常情况下身体会自行清除这种寄生虫。  

But the parasite's larvae got into the teen's brain through his bloodstream, causing him to fall into a coma for over 400 days.  

但寄生虫的幼虫通过血液进入了少年的大脑，导致他昏迷超过400天。  

When he finally woke up, he had severe brain damage and could only control his eyelids and breathing.  

当他最终醒来时，他的大脑受到严重损伤，只能控制眼睑和呼吸。  

He spent the next 8 years completely paralyzed until he passed away from respiratory failure in 2018.  

他在接下来的8年里完全瘫痪，直到2018年因呼吸衰竭去世。  

### [The Mountain Dew Mouse Controversy](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fB-rmuxxnpw)

A man claimed he found a dead mouse inside a can of Mountain Dew he was drinking, so he sued the soda's parent company, PepsiCo.  

一名男子声称他在喝的Mountain Dew（雪碧）罐中发现了一只死老鼠，因此他起诉了这款饮料的母公司百事可乐。  

PepsiCo argued that Mountain Dew's highly acidic formula would actually dissolve a mouse body into a jelly-like substance before anyone could ever even notice it in the can.  

百事可乐辩称，Mountain Dew的高酸性配方会在任何人注意到之前，将老鼠的身体溶解成类似果冻的物质。  

This odd defense left consumers worrying about what the **soda**(苏打/碳酸水) really does to the human body if it can **liquefy**(液化/溶解/ˈlɪkwɪfaɪ/) a mouse.  

这种奇怪的辩护让消费者担心，如果它能液化一只老鼠，这种汽水对人体到底会产生什么影响。

### [How Does a Hen Lay an Egg?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oUZI0OmabZk)

An egg starts in the ovary of a **hen**(母鸡) where the yolk begins to develop.  

鸡蛋起源于母鸡的卵巢，蛋黄开始发育。  

Over the course of a few days, it matures and is released into a long coiled tube.  

几天后，蛋黄成熟并被释放到一条长长的盘曲管道中。  

There it meets up with the egg white, which begins to form around it.  

在那里，蛋黄与蛋白相遇，蛋白开始在蛋黄周围形成。  

As the egg continues to move down the tube, the shell gradually develops.  

随着鸡蛋继续沿管道向下移动，蛋壳逐渐形成。  

And after about a day, the egg is laid.  

大约一天后，鸡蛋被产出。  

### [Can We Stop an Asteroid?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VGdE5Jojqvg)

If a huge asteroid were headed toward Earth, most people think we could deflect it by **blowing**(炸毁) it up.  

如果一颗巨大的小行星正朝地球飞来，大多数人认为我们可以通过炸毁它来改变它的轨道。  

But gravity could pull the exploded pieces back together, and it would continue along the same path, sort of **defeating the purpose**.  

但引力可能会将爆炸的碎片重新聚合，使它沿着同样的轨道继续前进，这样就失去了意义。  

Another option is to wrap the asteroid with reflective foil.  

另一个选择是用反光箔包裹小行星。  

This would change the way it absorbs heat, making it move by itself.  

这样可以改变它吸收热量的方式，使其自行移动。  

But this theory hasn't been tested.  

但这个理论尚未经过测试。  

And while astronomers can typically track these large asteroids, we still don't know if they can really be stopped.  

虽然天文学家通常可以追踪这些大型小行星，但我们仍然不知道它们是否真的可以被阻止。  

### [Why Do Martial Artists Kick Hard Surfaces?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cViuPoMjOV0)

Some martial artists intentionally hurt their **shins**(胫骨/攀/爬) by kicking hard surfaces, and they do this to make them stronger.  

一些武术家故意通过踢硬物来伤害他们的小腿，他们这样做是为了让小腿更强壮。  

You see, when shins are **subjected to**(遭受/承受) repeated impact, it causes small fractures in the bone.  

当小腿经常受到撞击时，会导致骨头出现微小的骨折。  

Over time, these fractures heal, which reinforces the bone with additional layers of calcium.  

随着时间推移，这些骨折会愈合，并通过增加钙层来强化骨头。  

This forms new bone tissue, making the shin denser and more resistant to fracturing again.  

这会形成新的骨组织，使小腿骨更加致密，并更能抵抗再次骨折。  

### [The Man Who Cut Off His Own Arm to Survive](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hBiMvvdaE8I)

An 800lb **boulder**(巨石) fell on a man's forearm while exploring a **canyon**(峡谷) in Utah.  

在犹他州探险时，一块800磅的巨石砸到了一个男人的前臂上。  

He was pinned against the rock wall, unable to move for five grueling days.  

他被压在岩壁上，整整五天无法动弹。  

He tried everything to free himself, but nothing worked, and his arm began to decompose.  

他尝试了一切方法解救自己，但都无济于事，他的手臂开始腐烂。  

So he made the difficult decision to cut off his arm using a dull pocket knife and **pliers**(钳子).  

于是他做出了艰难的决定，用一把钝的折叠刀和钳子切断了自己的手臂。  

The painful task took 1 hour, but he was finally free.  

这个痛苦的过程持续了一个小时，但他最终获得了自由。  

He repelled down the canyon wall and hiked 6 miles before finding help.

His severed arm was later recovered and cremated, and 6 months later, he scattered the ashes on the boulder that nearly took his life.  

他被切断的手臂后来被找回并火化，6个月后，他将骨灰撒在了差点害死他的那块巨石上。  

### [How Stethoscopes Changed Medicine](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BzZZRthVvG0)

Doctors use **stethoscopes**(听诊器) to listen to your heartbeat, and this works when sound waves cause the flat part to vibrate, transmitting the sound.  

医生使用听诊器听你的心跳，当声波使平坦的部分振动并传递声音时，这才起作用。  

But before stethoscopes were invented, doctors would just listen to your chest with their ears.  

但在听诊器发明之前，医生会直接用耳朵听你的胸部。  

If they heard a heartbeat, they assumed you were alive.  

如果他们听到心跳，他们认为你还活着。  

But if they couldn't hear it, they would sometimes pronounce you dead.  

但如果听不到心跳，他们有时会宣布你死亡。  

This caused a legitimate fear that if the heartbeat wasn't heard, people might actually be buried alive.  

这引发了人们的合理担忧：如果听不到心跳，人们可能真的会被活埋。

### [How Do Snakes Shed Their Skin?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qxvmEN8KQsg)

A snake will rub its face on a rough object to start shedding its skin.

This will begin to turn the old skin **inside out**(内外翻转) so that the snake can **wriggle**(扭动/蠕动) free.  

这样会将旧皮翻转过来，从而让蛇挣脱出来。  

Underneath, the new skin has already formed, including over the snake's eyes.  

在旧皮下面，新皮已经形成，包括蛇眼上的部分。  

A milky layer of fluid fills the space between the old eye caps and the new ones, making the snake partially blind.  

一层乳白色的液体充满了旧眼罩和新眼罩之间的空间，使蛇部分失明。  

But when the snake sheds its old skin, its sight is restored.  

但当蛇蜕下旧皮后，它的视力就会恢复。  

### [How Do Smart Bullets Change Direction?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JaTCu70CNAw)

If you shoot a gun with a smart bullet inside, it can actually change direction after being fired.  

如果你射出一颗智能子弹，它实际上可以在发射后改变方向。  

It works because of tiny sensors on the inside that gather data about the bullet's surroundings.  

它的原理是通过内部的微型传感器收集子弹周围环境的数据。  

Once the target is identified, the sensor rapidly sends information to tiny fins on the body of the bullet.  

一旦目标被确认，传感器会迅速将信息发送到子弹上的微型翼片。  

These fins adjust, changing the flight path midair to hit the target.  

这些翼片会调整，从而在空中改变飞行路径击中目标。  

### [Why Can You Watch a Sunset Twice from a Tall Building?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gbs9quUuRwc)

If you watch the sunset from the base of the world's tallest building, then take a fast elevator to the top floor, you can watch the same sunset a second time.  

如果你在世界上最高建筑的底部观看日落，然后快速乘电梯到顶层，你可以再次看到同样的日落。 

This is possible because the Earth is round, and the higher up you get, the further down the horizon you can see.  

这是因为地球是圆的，你爬得越高，看到的地平线越远。  

This also works if you watch the sunset lying down. Stand up quickly, and you'll see it again.  

这同样适用于躺着看日落。快速站起来，你会再次看到日落。  

### [How to Trick a Polygraph Test](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YqP_sCxBLgY)

If you lie while taking a polygraph, the machine will detect your stress and anxiety, which causes spikes in the readings.  

如果你在测谎时撒谎，机器会检测到你的压力和焦虑，从而导致读数出现尖峰。  

But if you put a thumbtack in your shoe during the pre-interview control questions, you can use it to **spike**(猛增/急升) your own stress and anxiety.  

但如果你在预采访控制问题期间在鞋子里放一颗图钉，你可以用它来人为地提升自己的压力和焦虑。  

The pain of pushing down on the thumbtack can raise your baseline reactions.  

踩着图钉的疼痛可以提升你的基线反应。  

Then when you tell a lie during the test, the spikes look normal, making your answers appear true.  

然后，当你在测试中撒谎时，尖峰看起来很正常，从而使你的答案看起来是真实的。  

### [Can You Be Thrown Off a Water Slide?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/B7Vr-a5I4dE)

Could you be thrown off of a water slide if you go too fast?  

如果你滑得太快，你会被从水滑梯上甩出去吗？  

Well, as you're sliding, gravity is constantly pulling you downward, and the amount of water between your skin and the slide helps control your speed.  

当你滑行时，重力会不断将你拉向下，而你皮肤与滑梯之间的水量会帮助控制你的速度。  

The curves and **turns**(拐弯) are carefully designed to ensure that you stay on the slide.  

滑梯的弯曲和转弯是经过精心设计的，以确保你能保持在滑梯上。  

But if you exceed the weight and height limits, there is a chance that it could go poorly for you.  

但如果你超过了体重和身高限制，那么你可能会遇到麻烦。

### [How Does Cold Branding Work?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T0qS4bRouTI)

Traditional branding can be very painful as the hot iron burns into an animal's skin, leaving behind a scar.  

传统的烙印非常痛苦，因为炽热的烙铁会灼烧动物的皮肤，留下疤痕。  

So instead of heat, some **ranchers**(ranch => 大农场/大牧场) use a **branding iron**(烙铁) that is cooled using liquid nitrogen.  

因此，一些牧场主使用液氮冷却的烙铁代替热烙铁。  

The iron is placed on the skin, and the extreme cold numbs the area as it freezes the skin cells, causing them to die.  

冷烙铁放在皮肤上，极冷会麻痹该区域，同时冻死皮肤细胞。  

As the skin thaws, it **blisters**(起疱/起泡/水疱/气泡) and eventually falls off while it heals, leaving behind a scar.  

随着皮肤解冻，它会起水泡并最终脱落，愈合后留下疤痕。  

### [Why Do Some Phones Explode?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/il67tH1RVfA)

2016年，一部三星手机在一名男子的口袋里过热，最终爆炸，导致男子腿部二度烧伤。  

This happened because the battery's casing was made too small on this particular model.  

这起事故的原因是该型号的电池外壳设计得太小。  

It caused the electrodes inside to bend and make contact with each other.  

这导致电池内部的电极弯曲并相互接触。  

This led to a short circuit, which eventually made the battery overheat.  

这引发了短路，最终导致电池过热。  

This created a cycle of chemical reactions that continually generated more and more heat until the phone eventually exploded.  

这一过程引发了一系列化学反应，不断产生更多热量，直到手机最终爆炸。  

### [How to Escape a Car Trunk?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ia_Qwke1gEc)

If you're trapped in the trunk of a vehicle, you should immediately start searching for the **glow-in-the-dark**(夜光) release hatch.  

如果你被困在车的后备箱里，你应该立即寻找发光的释放开关。  

If you don't see the latch, don't panic. Trunks are not airtight, so there's no risk of running out of oxygen.  

如果看不到开关，不要惊慌。后备箱不是密封的，因此不会缺氧。  

Try feeling around the edges of the trunk for a handle. This may allow you to release the seat back.  

尝试在后备箱的边缘摸索把手，这可能会让你放倒座椅。  

As a last resort, kick out one of the brake lights.  

如果没有其他办法，可以踢掉一个刹车灯。  

This small opening will allow you to signal for help.  

这个小开口可以让你发出求救信号。  

### [Why Can Eating Bear Meat Be Dangerous?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/N_l422xCo3Y)

Meat from a bear can sometimes contain an infectious parasite.  

熊肉有时可能含有一种传染性寄生虫。  

Once ingested, the larvae are released in your stomach and migrate to your small intestine.  

摄入后，幼虫会在胃中释放，并迁移到小肠。  

There, they mature and reproduce, and the newborn larvae eventually enter your bloodstream.  

在小肠中，它们成熟并繁殖，新的幼虫最终进入血液循环。  

These larvae burrow into your muscle, which causes intense pain as they form a hardened protective cyst around themselves.  

这些幼虫会钻入肌肉，形成坚硬的保护囊，导致剧烈疼痛。  

And they can remain dormant inside these cysts for years.  

它们可以在这些囊中休眠多年。

If you get struck by lightning, there's a theory that you're actually more likely to get struck again.  

如果你被雷击过，有一种理论认为，你实际上更有可能再次被雷击。  

They say this is because the electricity passing through your body can create **fern**(蕨)-like scar patterns.  

据说这是因为电流通过身体时会在皮肤上形成蕨类状的疤痕图案。  

Some people think that this changes the conductivity of your skin, making you more susceptible to be struck again.  

有些人认为这会改变皮肤的导电性，使你更容易再次被雷击。  

But in reality, people who are struck multiple times are usually just in more situations that put them at a higher risk.  

但实际上，多次被雷击的人通常只是处于更容易被雷击的环境中。

### [What Happens During a Brain Aneurysm?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qZ94_8UQ2FA)

A brain **aneurysm**(动脉瘤/ˈænjərɪzəm/) occurs when a blood vessel in your brain **bulges**(鼓起/突出) and bursts, leading to severe bleeding.  

脑动脉瘤发生时，大脑中的血管膨胀并破裂，导致严重出血。  

This happens when there's a weak spot in the wall of your blood vessel.  

这是因为血管壁上存在薄弱点。  

Over time, the blood causes this spot to balloon outwards.  

随着时间推移，血液会使这个薄弱点向外膨胀。  

And if left undetected, the wall could eventually rupture, causing blood to leak into your brain tissue.  

如果不被发现，血管壁最终可能破裂，血液会渗入大脑组织。  

This increases the pressure inside the brain, causing an often fatal stroke.  

这会增加大脑内的压力，通常会引发致命的中风。  

### [How Does Dynamite Work?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nNGLL2PHxcY)

When you light a stick of dynamite, the fuse burns down to a small charge called a blasting cap.  

当点燃一根炸药时，引信会燃烧到一个名为雷管的小型装置。  

Then the **blasting cap**(爆破帽/雷管) detonates, which creates a small explosion that sets off the main part of the dynamite.  

随后雷管引爆，产生小型爆炸，从而引发炸药的主要部分。  

Inside, a chemical called **nitroglycerin**(硝化甘油/ˌnaɪtroʊˈɡlɪsərɪn/) rapidly decomposes, producing a large amount of gas in a very short period of time.  

内部的硝化甘油化学物质会迅速分解，在极短时间内产生大量气体。  

This gas expands quickly, which results in a big explosion.  

气体迅速膨胀，最终导致剧烈爆炸。  

### [How to Survive a Grizzly Bear Encounter?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Vvc5OojABBU)

If you encounter a grizzly bear and try to run, they'll easily catch you. Instead, stay calm and avoid eye contact while slowly backing away.  

如果遇到灰熊并试图逃跑，它们很容易追上你。相反，要保持冷静，避免眼神接触，同时慢慢后退。  

If the bear charges, stand your ground because most charges are actually bluffs.  

如果熊冲过来，要坚持住，因为大多数冲锋实际上是虚张声势。  

If it does attack, lie flat on your stomach, covering your neck with your hands.  

如果它真的攻击你，趴在地上，用手保护住脖子。  

Stay still and play dead, as grizzlies often lose interest if they perceive no threat.  

保持不动装死，因为灰熊通常在没有威胁时会失去兴趣。  

### [What Happens During an Autopsy?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NuRwN2euRnA)

A Y-shaped incision is made down to the **pelvis**(骨盆) to open up the abdomen during an autopsy.  

在尸检过程中，会沿着胸口到骨盆划开一个“Y”形切口以打开腹部。  

Then they will remove each organ one by one and examine it for anything abnormal.  

随后他们会逐一取出器官并检查是否有异常。  

If the liver has unusual **spots**(斑点) or discoloration, it can indicate some kind of poisoning.  

如果肝脏有异常斑点或变色，可能表明某种中毒情况。  

And examining a bullet lodged in the heart can help determine the trajectory and type of gun.  

检查嵌在心脏中的子弹可以帮助确定弹道和枪械类型。  

Once the pathologist is satisfied, the organs are all returned, and the body is **sewn**(sew/soʊ/) shut.  

当病理学家完成检查后，所有器官会被放回，随后缝合尸体。  

### [A Tragic Rescue Attempt in an Indian Village](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xNWv4QLwseo)

井里的废物散发出有毒气体。当主人呼救时，他的儿子跳下井去救人，但也被困住了。  

Three more members of the family tried to help, jumping in one after the other, but they all got stuck in the well.  

家庭中的另外三名成员试图救援，依次跳下井，但他们也都被困住了。  

Finally, a sixth family member entered with a rope around his waist. He was pulled out after the villagers heard the cries, and the other five men were suffocated by the well's toxic gases.  

最终，第六个家庭成员腰上绑着绳子下井。在村民听到呼救声后，他被拉了出来，而另外五人则因井内的有毒气体窒息身亡。

### [Can a Bullet Ricochet Back to Kill the Shooter?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OtM2LsHaPbY)

If you fire a bullet that ricochets off of three platforms, some people think it could come back and kill the shooter.  

如果你射出的子弹从三个平台反弹，有人认为它可能会反弹回来杀死射手。  

But is this actually possible?  

但这真的可能发生吗？  

Well, first, the bullet would need to hit at just the right angle to be redirected back, and each of these hits would cause it to lose large amounts of energy and speed.  

首先，子弹需要以极其精准的角度反弹回去，而每次反弹都会让它损失大量的能量和速度。  

It could technically come back and hit you, but it would no longer be at a lethal speed.  

理论上它可能会反弹回来击中你，但速度已不足以致命。  

### [How to Survive Being Tied to Train Tracks?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Vnsmo-F73Ws)

If you're tied to train tracks and there's a train approaching, you might think there's no way to survive.  

如果你被绑在铁轨上，火车正在驶来，你可能会认为没有生还的可能。  

Now, as soon as you're spotted, the conductor will apply the emergency brakes, but it'll still take several hundred feet for the train to stop.  

一旦被发现，司机会拉下紧急刹车，但火车仍需数百英尺才能停下。  

If you can't escape, your last resort would be to try and position yourself in the tiny space between the train and the tracks and hope you don't get hit.  

如果无法逃脱，你最后的选择是试图躺在火车和铁轨之间的狭小空间，并祈祷自己不会被撞到。

如果你在半夜从坟墓中爬出来，你可能是个僵尸。  

But what exactly is a zombie, and could they actually exist?  

那么，僵尸究竟是什么？它们真的存在吗？  

Well, coming back from the dead might not be the only way to be considered one.  

从死亡中复活可能并不是成为僵尸的唯一方式。  

Another defining characteristic is that they don't have a working brain.  

另一个定义特征是它们的大脑无法正常运作。  

And there are viruses that are known to attack the host's brain, essentially taking over their mind while they remain physically active.  

已知有些病毒会攻击宿主的大脑，基本上接管其思维，而宿主的身体仍然可以活动。  

Meaning zombies could exist, depending on how you define them.  

这意味着僵尸可能存在，取决于你如何定义它们。  

### [How Many Earths Could Fit Inside the Sun?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-VQo3f8ZPSA)

If you poured a bunch of Earths inside the Sun, they say it can hold 1.3 million of them.  

如果你把许多地球装进太阳，据说可以装下130万个地球。  

But this calculation is actually wrong.  

但这个计算实际上是错误的。  

You see, this figure is just taking the volume of each Earth to fill the sun, almost like a liquid.  

你看，这个数字仅仅是以每个地球的体积填满太阳，几乎像是在装液体一样。  

But that doesn't take into account that the Earth is a sphere and that there would be space between each one.  

但这没有考虑到地球是球体，球体之间会有空间。  

Now, if you factor in this packing density, instead of 1.3 million, it would actually only take about 960,000.  

如果将密度计算进去，而不是130万，实际只能装下约96万个地球。  

### [What Happens if You Shoot a Bullet at a Grenade?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/H7lK8Iprhww)

但事实并非如此。  

You see, it would be almost impossible to hit the explosive charge inside the grenade as it's flying through the air.  

你会发现，几乎不可能击中手榴弹内部的爆炸装置，尤其是在它飞行途中。  

And even if you did manage to hit it, a normal gun wouldn't have enough energy to actually detonate the charge inside.  

即使你真的击中了，普通枪支的能量也不足以引爆内部装置。

### [A Toddler Survives a Chopstick in His Brain](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sL-oQcdhPxQ)

In 2014, a toddler stuck a chopstick in his nose and somehow pushed it up his nasal passage and 3 inches into his brain.  

2014年，一名幼儿把一根筷子插进鼻子里，并且不知怎么推到了鼻腔内部，深入大脑3英寸。  

He was immediately rushed to the hospital, where doctors had to surgically remove it while trying not to cause more damage.  

他立刻被送往医院，医生必须通过手术将筷子取出，同时尽量避免造成更多伤害。  

But the chopstick somehow missed major nerves and arteries and was eventually removed with no long-term damage.  

然而，筷子奇迹般地避开了重要的神经和动脉，最终被取出，没有留下长期损伤。  

### [How an Anteater Feasts on Ants](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KwmgCMNVK0I)

An anteater's tongue is so long that it can reach the bottom of a huge ant hill.  

食蚁兽的舌头非常长，可以伸到一个巨大的蚁丘底部。  

Once inside, they use their tongue to navigate the tunnels while looking for ants.  

进入蚁丘后，它们用舌头在隧道中四处探索寻找蚂蚁。  

Then they'll flick in and out rapidly, trapping the ants on their tongue.  

然后它们会快速地吞吐舌头，将蚂蚁粘在舌头上。  

They can do this because their tongues are coated in a sticky saliva.  

它们之所以能做到这一点，是因为舌头上涂满了粘性的唾液。  

They'll suck their tongue back inside their mouths and **feast**(饱餐/宴请) on the ants.  

它们将舌头吸回嘴里，享用这些蚂蚁。  

### [Why Cutting Toenails Wrong Can Cause Ingrown Nails](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FIJpt9eHXis)

Some people cut the sides of their toenails to avoid them becoming ingrown, but this can actually make them worse.  

一些人剪掉脚趾甲的边缘以避免嵌甲，但这实际上可能让情况更糟。  

You see, if you cut them with a rounded edge, the nail will follow this curved path as it grows.  

如果你将趾甲剪成圆弧形，趾甲会沿着这个弯曲的路径生长。  

This can make the nail dig into the sides of your toe, causing it to pierce the skin and grow inward.  

这会让趾甲嵌入脚趾两侧，刺穿皮肤并向内生长。  

Instead, you should just cut them **straight across**(笔直穿过).  

相反，你应该直接将趾甲剪成直线。  

### [The Probability of Choosing the Right Wire to Defuse a Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xLccN8V8hII)

Imagine you're trying to deactivate a bomb with a red, yellow, and blue wire.  

想象一下，你正在尝试拆除一个有红色、黄色和蓝色电线的炸弹。  

Now, one of these wires is the correct option, and **snipping**(剪) it will stop the bomb from exploding.  

其中一根电线是正确的，剪断它可以阻止炸弹爆炸。  

But the other two wires will cause the bomb to go off if they're snipped.  

但如果剪断其他两根电线，炸弹就会爆炸。  

You choose the yellow wire, but before you snip it, you receive a text from the bomb's manufacturer, who is watching you on a security camera.  

你选择了黄色电线，但在剪断之前，你收到了一条来自炸弹制造者的短信，他通过监控摄像头在观察你。  

He informs you that the red wire would detonate the bomb.  

他告诉你，红色电线会引爆炸弹。  

So now you must choose between yellow or blue, and you might assume that it doesn't matter because it's 50/50, but that's not actually the case.  

现在你必须在黄色和蓝色之间选择，你可能认为这无所谓，因为概率是50/50，但事实并非如此。  

In the beginning, each wire had a 1/3 chance of being correct.  

一开始，每根电线正确的概率是1/3。  

When you chose yellow, the other two wires had a combined chance of 2/3.  

当你选择黄色时，其余两根电线的总概率是2/3。  

And when red was identified as the wrong wire, the odds didn't actually change; they were just reflected onto the blue wire.  

而当红色被确认是错误的电线时，概率实际上并没有改变，而是转移到了蓝色电线上。  

Which means your chances are better if you switch to blue.  

这意味着，如果你改选蓝色，胜算更大。  

### [The Risks of Drinking Too Much Water](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PWJcrvBcLzo)

If you drink too much water, the excess will fill up your stomach and get absorbed into your bloodstream.  

如果你喝了过量的水，多余的水会填满你的胃，并被吸收到血液中。  

This can eventually cause your brain cells to swell up, which pushes your brain into your skull and increases the pressure.  

这最终会导致你的脑细胞肿胀，将大脑挤压到颅骨里，增加压力。  

And depending on your size, if you drink around 6 liters of water in a few hours, your brain would swell up so much that you could go into a coma and die.  

根据你的体型，如果在几小时内喝下大约6升的水，你的大脑会严重肿胀，可能会导致昏迷甚至死亡。

### [What Happens If You Stomp on a Spider?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NrV8oOV64tI)

If you **stomp**(跺脚/重踩) on a spider, you might end up releasing a swarm of hundreds of babies all at once.  

如果你踩死一只蜘蛛，可能会一下子释放出成百上千只小蜘蛛。  

And this is because some spiders don't actually lay their eggs in a web.  

这是因为有些蜘蛛实际上不会在网中产卵。  

Instead, they have to carry around their **egg sacks**(卵囊), which are connected to their **spinnerets**(吐丝器).  

它们会把卵囊连接在吐丝器上，随身携带。  

Once the sack hatches, the baby spiders will crawl up the mother's back.  

当卵囊孵化后，小蜘蛛会爬上母蜘蛛的背部。  

And if you happen to step on the spider, the babies will swarm the area.  

如果你刚好踩到了母蜘蛛，小蜘蛛就会迅速四散。  

### [What Happens If You Fire a Bullet in Space?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LyspcR7-rUU)

If you fired a bullet in space, some people think the energy would just propel you back, but that's not exactly what would happen.  

如果你在太空中开枪，有人认为反作用力会将你弹回去，但事实并非如此。  

You see, in the vacuum of space, there's no air resistance, and that means there is nothing to slow the bullet down.  

在太空的真空环境中，没有空气阻力，这意味着没有任何东西能减慢子弹速度。  

So when you pull the trigger, you would be slightly pushed back.  

因此，当你扣动扳机时，你会受到一点反作用力往后推。  

But unless it hits something, the bullet would continue traveling in a straight line forever.  

但除非子弹碰到某物，否则它会一直沿直线飞行，永不停歇。  

### [How to Safely Remove a Cholla Cactus Spine](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CO9qSYtosmc)

If you lightly brush by a **cholla**(多刺仙人掌) cactus, the segments detach at the lightest touch, and the barbed spines would easily penetrate your skin.  

如果你轻轻碰到跳刺仙人掌，它的刺段会在最轻微的触碰下脱落，而带钩刺会很容易刺入你的皮肤。  

But when you try to pull them out, the tiny backwards-facing hooks on the spine dig deeper, causing more pain.  

但当你尝试拔出这些刺时，刺上细小的倒钩会更深入，导致更大的疼痛。  

To remove them, use a comb to gently lift the spines away from the skin, then use tweezers to individually remove each one.  

要拔出这些刺，可以用梳子轻轻挑起刺离开皮肤，然后用镊子一根根拔除。  

### [How Hydro Dipping Works](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6UpWUJG7kEk)

If you dip a shoe into this tank of water, it will come out with a pattern.  

如果你将一只鞋子浸入这个水槽中，它会带着一个图案出来。  

And this works because a print with a special **film**(薄层) is placed on top of the water.  

这是因为一张带有特殊薄膜的图案被放置在水面上。  

Applied activators dissolve this film, leaving just the print floating as ink.  

启用剂会溶解薄膜，只留下漂浮的油墨图案。  

And when the shoe is submerged, the ink wraps around it and adheres.  

当鞋子被浸入水中时，图案会包裹住它并附着上去。  

It's then carefully removed from the water to keep the wet ink on the object.  

然后小心地将鞋子从水中取出，以保持湿油墨附着在物体上。  

### [What Happens If Everyone on Earth Farted at Once?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-TcrJrDT6V8)

If everyone on Earth farted at the same time, you might think the combined release of gas would create an unprecedented global explosion.  

如果地球上的每个人同时放屁，你可能会认为这股气体会引发前所未有的全球爆炸。  

But is this actually true? Well, human farts can contain trace amounts of highly flammable gas.  

但这是真的吗？实际上，人类的屁中可能含有微量的高易燃气体。  

But even if all 8 billion people released this gas, it still wouldn't be enough to have a serious impact.  

但即使全世界80亿人同时释放这种气体，它仍然不足以造成严重影响。  

It would just cause loud sounds and intense smells.  

它只会产生巨大的声响和浓烈的气味。

### [What Happens If You Get Rabies?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o51Cv6Zv-ww)

If you get rabies, the virus travels from the wound to your brain.  

如果你感染了狂犬病，病毒会从伤口传播到你的大脑。  

As it reaches your brain, you'll start to experience flu-like symptoms.  

当病毒到达大脑时，你会开始出现类似流感的症状。  

Over time, it can cause confusion, agitation, and even a fear of water.  

随着时间推移，病毒会引起意识混乱、躁动，甚至怕水症状。  

And this fear of water makes swallowing almost impossible, leading to excessive saliva that foams out of the mouth.  

这种怕水症状会让吞咽几乎变得不可能，导致口水过多并从嘴中流出泡沫。  

After a while, you'll go into a coma, and with no cure, you'll eventually die.  

过了一段时间，你会陷入昏迷，由于没有治愈方法，最终会死亡。  

### [What Happens If You Swallow a Live Octopus?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qYiIcqEyMh8)

If you swallowed a live octopus and your stomach had no digestive fluids, the octopus would pass through it completely whole.  

如果你吞下一只活章鱼，而你的胃没有消化液，这只章鱼将完整无损地通过胃部。  

And this is because they're very resilient and don't have any bones, making them incredibly flexible.  

这是因为章鱼非常有韧性，没有骨骼，这让它们极其柔韧。  

If it didn't suffocate, the octopus could travel down into your intestines and through your digestive system.  

如果它没有窒息，章鱼可能会进入你的肠道并穿过你的消化系统。  

Eventually, it would make it all the way through and come out of your butt alive.  

最终，它会活着从你的肛门排出体外。  

### [How Many Balloons Would It Take to Lift a House?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hkQHmXU5k1U)

It would take about 5,000 balloons to lift the average person into the air.  

让一个普通人飞上天，大约需要5000个气球。  

But how many would it take to lift your house?  

但要让你的房子飞起来需要多少气球呢？  

In the movie *Up*, the house is lifted with just 10,000 balloons, but that actually wouldn't work in real life.  

在电影《飞屋环游记》中，房子被1万只气球托起，但在现实生活中这是行不通的。  

You see, a typical house weighs about 100,000 lb, and each balloon can only hold about half of an ounce.  

你知道，普通房子的重量大约是10万磅，而每个气球只能承载约半盎司的重量。  

Using that math, you would need just about 4 million balloons to lift a typical house.  

按这个计算，你大约需要400万个气球才能让普通房子升空。  

### [The Woman Sucked Out of a Plane Window](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9GKquxMrVYE)

In 2018, a woman was sucked out of a window on a Southwest flight headed to Dallas.  

2018年，在一架飞往达拉斯的西南航空航班上，一名女子被吸出窗外。  

It happened when an engine broke in the air, causing debris to break a window.  

事情发生在飞行途中，一台引擎损坏，碎片击碎了一扇窗户。  

This caused the cabin to depressurize and suck the nearby woman out of the plane.  

这导致机舱失压，将附近的一名女子吸出飞机外。  

The other passengers held on to her as she hung halfway out.  

其他乘客抓住她，而她半个身体挂在窗外。  

And after a few minutes, they were able to get her back into the plane, but she had severe head trauma, which unfortunately caused her to die.  

几分钟后，他们将她拉回飞机内，但她因严重的头部创伤不幸身亡。  

### [How Does an Epilator Work?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lpquxPkwvno)

An **epilator**(脱毛器) works by rapidly plucking hairs from the root, removing the entire strand.  

脱毛器通过快速拔除毛发根部，将整根毛发去除。  

And it's kind of like a bunch of tweezers with a rotating head that grabs multiple hairs and pulls them out at the same time.  

它有点像一堆镊子，带有旋转头，可以一次抓住多根毛发并拔除。  

Now, this process can leave your skin hair-free for weeks.  

这种过程可以让你的皮肤在数周内保持无毛状态。  

But frequent use can actually cause your hair **follicles**(毛囊) to weaken, leading to ingrown hairs.  

但频繁使用会导致毛囊变弱，从而引发内生毛发问题。

### [How to Properly Remove a Tick](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GlXd15iUe4M)

If a **tick**(壁虱) bites you and embeds itself into your skin, most people think you should just go ahead and pull it out.  

如果一只蜱虫咬了你并嵌入你的皮肤，大多数人认为你应该直接把它拔出来。  

But if the tick is fully in your skin, this can actually cause the body to break off, leaving its head stuck inside.  

但是如果蜱虫完全嵌入你的皮肤，这实际上会导致蜱虫的身体断裂，头部留在体内。  

Instead, you should use tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin's surface as possible.  

相反，你应该用镊子尽量靠近皮肤表面夹住蜱虫。  

Then slowly pull the tick upwards with even pressure.  

然后用均匀的力缓慢向上拔出蜱虫。  

### [What Happens When You Detonate a Claymore Mine?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jCslJpDARdc)

If you detonate a Claymore Mine, it causes an explosion behind hundreds of metal beads.  

如果你引爆了一枚克雷莫地雷，它会在后方引发爆炸，抛出数百颗金属珠。  

Now, these beads are embedded in a curved plastic backing, which directs the force of the explosion outwards.  

这些金属珠嵌在一个弯曲的塑料背板中，这种背板会将爆炸力引导向外。  

As they shoot out, they cover a wide area in front of the mine, causing severe injuries and worse.  

当这些金属珠飞出时，它们会覆盖地雷前方的大范围区域，造成严重伤害甚至更糟的后果。  

### [The Train Dilemma: Pull the Lever or Not?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vrM-WPticV8)

This train is headed straight towards five people.  

这列火车正径直朝五个人驶去。  

Now, if you pull this lever, the train will divert to another track where only one person is tied down.  

如果你拉下这个拉杆，火车会改道驶向另一条轨道，而那里只有一个人被绑着。  

Most people would choose to pull the lever, taking one life to save the five.  

大多数人会选择拉动拉杆，用牺牲一个人的生命换取五个人的生命。  

But now imagine that you're a surgeon, and you have five dying patients who all need a different organ transplant to live.  

但现在假设你是一位外科医生，你有五名垂死的病人，他们各自需要不同的器官移植才能存活。  

You could harvest the organs from one healthy person, which would save the five dying patients but end his life.  

你可以从一个健康人身上取出器官，这样可以拯救五名垂死的病人，但健康人会因此丧命。  

So, does saving five lives really justify taking one? What do you think?  

那么，拯救五条生命真的能为夺走一条生命提供理由吗？你怎么看？  

### [How Does a Metal Detector Work?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/E56SjqUk7iU)

If you put a metal detector over something metal, it will beep.  

如果你把金属探测器放在金属物体上，它会发出哔哔声。  

And it does this because the detector emits an electromagnetic field into the ground.  

这是因为探测器会向地面发射电磁场。  

Now, this field goes right through most materials and objects beneath the dirt.  

这种电磁场可以穿透泥土下的大多数材料和物体。  

But when the detector hovers over a metal object, it actually disrupts this field, sending a signal back to the detector.  

但当探测器悬停在金属物体上时，它会干扰电磁场，并将信号返回探测器。  

This signal is converted into an audible alert, indicating that something metal is buried.  

这个信号会被转换成声音警报，表示有金属物体被埋藏。  

### [How Do Insulin Patches Work?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jhx3-h848IU)

A needle painlessly penetrates your skin when you apply an **insulin**(胰岛素) patch.  

当你使用胰岛素贴片时，一根针会无痛地穿透你的皮肤。  

Inside the patch, a small container holds insulin, which is released through a micro pump.  

贴片内部有一个小容器装着胰岛素，通过微型泵释放胰岛素。  

This pump delivers at programmed intervals, closely mimicking the body's natural insulin release.  

这个泵会按照设定的时间间隔释放胰岛素，模拟人体自然的胰岛素分泌。  

Sensors inside the patch monitor glucose levels, adjusting the insulin as needed and ensuring consistent blood sugar control.  

贴片内的传感器会监测血糖水平，根据需要调整胰岛素释放，确保血糖稳定控制。

### [What Happens If You Drop a Nuke Into a Volcano?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jBZqhynec5g)

If you dropped a nuke into an active volcano, it would most likely just melt before it could detonate.  

如果你把核弹丢进一个活火山中，它很可能会在引爆之前就融化。  

But if the nuke was transported into the magma chamber and timed just right, the intense explosion could vaporize the lava.  

但如果核弹被运送到岩浆室并在正确的时间引爆，剧烈的爆炸会将岩浆汽化。  

This lava vapor would rapidly expand, causing an enormous pressure wave.  

这种岩浆蒸汽会迅速膨胀，产生巨大的压力波。  

The explosion would send molten rock, ash, and gas high into the atmosphere.  

爆炸会将熔岩、火山灰和气体高高抛入大气层中。  

### [What Happens If You Fall Off a Cruise Ship?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gJN5IcmwyJU)

If you fall off of a cruise ship, you could hit at 40 mph, quickly submerging you deep into the water.  

如果你从邮轮上掉下去，你可能会以每小时40英里的速度落水，并迅速沉入深水中。  

But if you manage to make it back up, the ship will most likely be too far away, making it almost impossible to be seen.  

但如果你设法回到水面，邮轮很可能已经离得太远，几乎不可能被看到。  

Now, if someone saw you fall, they will stop the ship, but these rescue efforts can take a long time.  

如果有人看到你掉下去，他们会停船，但这些救援工作可能需要很长时间。  

So, you'll have to wait in the ocean for hours if they find you at all.  

所以，你可能需要在海里等待数小时，前提是他们能找到你。  

### [How to Safely Remove Porcupine Quills](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iZhIcevcIxw)

If you touch a **porcupine**(/ˈpɔːrkjupaɪn/), you'll get a bunch of their **quills**(刚毛/羽毛笔) stuck in your skin.  

如果你碰到一只豪猪，你的皮肤上会扎满它的刺。  

And these quills are barbed, making them really hard to remove once they're in.  

这些刺带有倒钩，一旦扎进去就很难拔出来。  

If you try to just rip them out, they can become buried deep enough to damage your skin and cause an infection.  

如果你试图直接拔出来，它们可能会扎得更深，损伤皮肤并引发感染。  

Instead, carefully use tweezers to grab the quill close to the skin and pull in the direction that it entered.  

相反，应该小心地用镊子夹住靠近皮肤的刺，并沿着刺进入的方向拔出。  

### [The First Monkey Head Transplant](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/blIpTvoClzo)

In 1970, a doctor removed the head of a monkey and transplanted it with another one.  

1970年，一位医生移除了猴子的头部，并将另一个猴子的头移植到它身上。  

Painstakingly connecting the tissues in the neck to the donor head, the monkey survived, regained consciousness, and was able to see and hear.  

医生费尽心力连接颈部的组织到捐赠头部，猴子存活下来，恢复了意识，并能够看到和听到。  

But the spinal cord couldn't be connected, so the monkey was unable to move its body.  

但脊髓无法连接，所以猴子无法移动身体。  

And while the procedure was technically successful, the monkey only lived for a few days.  

尽管手术在技术上是成功的，这只猴子仅存活了几天。  

### [What Happens If a Black Widow Bites You?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xBBJgx7ujrU)

If you're bitten by a black widow, glands near the mouth force venom through the fangs and into the wound.  

如果你被黑寡妇蜘蛛咬了，靠近口部的腺体会将毒液通过毒牙注入伤口。  

Then it quickly spreads to tissue surrounding the bite.  

然后毒液迅速扩散到咬伤周围的组织。  

This venom binds to nerve endings, causing them to fire rapidly.  

这种毒液会与神经末梢结合，导致神经快速放电。  

And this makes your muscles contract, leading to severe cramps and pain.  

这会让你的肌肉收缩，引发剧烈的痉挛和疼痛。  

But unless you're a small child, the bite is actually rarely fatal, just extremely painful.  

但除非你是小孩，否则这种咬伤很少致命，只是会非常痛苦。

### [The Man Who Survived a Rod Through His Skull](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kF6szkTavxc)

In 1848, a large iron rod drove through the face and head of a man while he was working on a railroad.  

1848年，一根巨大的铁棒穿过一名铁路工人的脸部和头部。  

It passed behind his left eye and exited through the top of his skull, and he somehow managed to stay conscious while the rod was removed.  

铁棒穿过他的左眼后方，并从头顶穿出，但他竟然在铁棒被取出时保持了清醒。  

Now, he did survive this incident, but he wasn't really the same person.  

他确实从这次事故中幸存下来，但他已经不再是原来的自己了。  

You see, the rod went through his frontal lobe, and this area of the brain is responsible for decision-making and self-control.  

因为铁棒穿过了他的额叶，这个大脑区域负责决策和自我控制。  

Because it was damaged, his entire personality changed. He became impulsive, erratic, and unpredictable.  

由于额叶受损，他的整个性格发生了改变。他变得冲动、反复无常且不可预测。  

### [What Happens If You're Swallowed by a Sperm Whale?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EtBUE4qKoy8)

If you were swallowed by a sperm whale, you would be squeezed down its massive throat.  

如果你被抹香鲸吞下，你会被挤压着穿过它巨大的喉咙。  

You'd continue down the esophagus and into a series of stomach chambers that are filled with digestive acids.  

你会继续沿着食道进入一系列充满消化液的胃室。  

And these acids would immediately start breaking down your body.  

这些消化液会立刻开始分解你的身体。  

But even if you managed to avoid the acid, the lack of air inside the whale would quickly cause you to suffocate.  

但即使你设法避开了消化液，鲸鱼体内缺乏空气也会迅速让你窒息而亡。  

### [Would a Cat Survive a Fall From the Burj Khalifa?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ydJ6MmcaUiw)

If you dropped a cat from the top of the Burj Khalifa, would it land on its feet?  

如果你从哈利法塔顶部丢下一只猫，它会四脚着地吗？  

Well, when dropped from a normal height, cats have this special reflex that allows them to twist their bodies midair in a fraction of a second, and this allows them to land on their feet.  

通常从正常高度跌落时，猫有一种特殊的反射，使它们能在空中瞬间扭转身体，从而四脚着地。  

But if dropped from the Burj Khalifa, this reflex wouldn't really help much.  

但如果从哈利法塔掉下去，这种反射并不会有太大帮助。  

After a certain height, the impact is just too intense, and it wouldn't really matter how the cat lands.  

达到一定高度后，撞击力实在太强，无论猫以什么姿势落地都无法幸存。  

### [Does Shooting a Gas Tank Cause an Explosion?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/77XHh_tVZ9w)

If you shot a gun at a gas tank in a car, most people assume that it would cause it to explode.  

如果你对汽车油箱开枪，大多数人会认为它会爆炸。  

But would this actually happen?  

但这真的会发生吗？  

Well, the tank usually doesn't have the right amount of oxygen to ignite, and a bullet might cause it to leak, but it wouldn't ignite without a spark.  

通常油箱内没有足够的氧气来引燃，子弹可能会导致油箱泄漏，但没有火花的话是不会点燃的。  

But if there was enough oxygen in the tank and the bullet created a big enough spark, the chances of an explosion are still low because gasoline burns rather than explodes.  

但如果油箱内有足够的氧气，且子弹产生了足够大的火花，爆炸的可能性依然很低，因为汽油是燃烧而非爆炸的。  

### [Can Ancient Armor Stop a Bullet?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ciIAcD4eXsI)

If you shot a bullet at ancient armor, some people think it could actually stop the impact.  

如果你对古代盔甲开枪，有些人认为它能够挡住子弹的冲击力。  

But armor like chain mail was designed to block **slashing**(猛烈的/猛砍) swords, and plate armor was even better at deflecting strikes by spreading the blunt force across more area, lessening its impact.  

然而，像锁子甲这样的盔甲是用来抵挡砍击的，而板甲更擅长通过分散钝器的冲击力来减轻伤害。  

But these materials weren't very good at stopping arrows, which had enough energy to enter the armor.  

但这些材料并不擅长抵挡弓箭，而弓箭有足够的能量射穿盔甲。  

So a bullet would have no trouble going right through.  

因此，子弹射穿盔甲完全不成问题。

### [How Does a Hydraulic Press Crush Objects?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CLDn6S0vkjU)

How does a hydraulic press completely crush almost anything you place in it?  

液压机是如何完全压碎几乎所有放进去的物体的？  

Well, when it's activated, a hydraulic pump **pressurizes**(增压) the liquid inside, pushing it into a cylinder.  

当液压机启动时，液压泵会对内部液体加压，将其推入一个液缸中。  

And this pressure increases so much because liquids are virtually incompressible.  

这种压力会显著增加，因为液体几乎无法被压缩。  

Which amplifies the force applied. As a result, the piston is pushed down onto the object, crushing it with a huge force.  

这会放大施加的力，从而推动活塞压向物体，用巨大的力将其压碎。  

### [What Should You Do If Your Car Is Hanging Off a Cliff?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uz6d8Aivffg)

If you're in a car that's hanging off a cliff, the best thing you can do is stay completely still.  

如果你在一辆悬挂在悬崖边的车里，最好的做法是保持完全静止。  

When the car settles, carefully unfasten your seat belt without making any sudden movements.  

当车稳定后，小心地解开安全带，避免任何突然的动作。  

Now, some people might try to open the door to escape, but this would probably cause the **teetering**(摇晃/摇摇欲坠) car to fall.  

有些人可能会尝试打开车门逃生，但这可能会导致摇摇欲坠的汽车坠落。  

Instead, roll down the windows, then gradually shift your weight towards the back.  

相反，可以摇下车窗，然后逐渐将身体重量向车后方移动。  

Once you're in a stable position, gently crawl out.  

当你处于稳定的位置时，小心地爬出来。  

### [Why Does Constipation Happen?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bCrzLDn-9fo)

Your poop normally travels smoothly all the way through your colon.  

排泄物通常会顺畅地通过你的大肠。  

But if you're **constipated**(便秘), your intestines absorb too much water from your poop.  

但如果你便秘了，你的肠道会从排泄物中吸收过多的水分。  

This makes it dry and hard, causing it to move very slowly through your **colon**(结肠/冒号/koʊlən/ˈkəʊlən; ˈkəʊlɒn/).  

这会使排泄物变得干燥坚硬，导致它在大肠中移动得非常缓慢。  

Eventually, the slow-moving poop impacts with more poop, causing a blockage.  

最终，缓慢移动的排泄物会与更多的排泄物堆积在一起，造成堵塞。  

And this can lead to a large, hard mass that completely stops the colon from moving your poop.  

这会形成一个巨大而坚硬的块状物，完全阻止大肠移动你的排泄物。  

### [Why Do You Get Déjà Vu?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0KU_sVVsel8)

If you get **déjà vu**(似曾相识), you feel like you're experiencing something you've already lived through.  

如果你感到似曾相识，你会觉得自己正在经历已经发生过的事情。  

So why does this happen?  

那么，为什么会这样呢？  

Well, some people think this happens when parallel universes **glitch**(小故障/失灵) and briefly align, causing you to connect with the other version of yourself.  

有些人认为，这发生在平行宇宙出现故障并短暂对齐时，导致你与另一个版本的自己产生联系。  

Others believe that it's a leftover memory from a past life bleeding through to your current life.  

另一些人认为，这是一段前世记忆的残留，渗透到了你的现世中。  

But in reality, the leading explanation is that your brain **misfires**(不奏效) and **mixes up**(混淆) present experience with memories, causing you to feel like you've seen it before.  

但实际上，主要的解释是你的大脑信号出错，将当前的经历与记忆混淆，使你觉得似曾相识。  

### [How Does a Pilot Eject to Safety?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rxj2kUrTeRk)

When a plane is going down, the pilot can pull a lever, which instantly triggers the **top hatch** to open.  

当飞机要坠毁时，飞行员可以拉动一个操纵杆，这会立即触发顶部舱门打开。  

As rocket motors beneath the seat begin to fire off, this launches the seat and pilot out of the plane and into the sky.  

座椅下方的火箭发动机开始点火，将座椅和飞行员从飞机中发射到空中。  

Stabilizing rockets activate to keep the seat upright, while a small chute deploys to slow the fall.  

稳定火箭会启动以保持座椅直立，同时一个小型降落伞会打开以减缓下降速度。  

Then the main parachute is released, ensuring a controlled descent to the ground.  

随后主降落伞被释放，确保飞行员以受控的方式降落到地面。

### [What Is Alien Hand Syndrome?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WmKkXxY9cXw)

If your hand starts to act on its own and chokes you, you probably have a condition called alien hand syndrome.  

如果你的手开始不受控制地行动，甚至掐住你的脖子，那你可能患有一种叫做“外星手综合症”的疾病。  

This rare disorder occurs when the part of your brain connecting both sides is damaged.  

这种罕见的疾病发生在连接大脑两侧的部分受损时。  

This causes the nerves in your hand to involuntarily fire, making it move by itself.  

这会导致手部的神经不由自主地发出信号，使手自己移动。  

And while choking is pretty rare, your alien hand can perform random tasks without your knowledge(认知) or approval.  

虽然掐脖子的情况很罕见，但你的“外星手”可能会在你不知情或未允许的情况下执行随机任务。  

### [How to Escape a Rip Current?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DaYvv4Syx54)

You can be sucked out to sea by an invisible current if you're swimming in the ocean.  

如果你在海中游泳，可能会被一种看不见的水流拖入海中。  

This happens when waves push water towards the beach, which then flows back out.  

这发生在海浪将水推向沙滩后，水又回流入海时。  

But in certain spots, this returning water forms a powerful, narrow channel that can suck you outwards from the shore.  

但在某些地方，这种回流的水会形成一个强大的狭窄水道，将你从岸边吸走。  

And these currents can be hundreds of feet long, extending into deep water.  

这些水流可能延伸数百英尺，进入深水区域。  

But you can escape the pull by swimming parallel to the shore and out of the current.  

但你可以通过平行于岸边游泳来逃离水流。  

### [How Does a Bunker Buster Bomb Work?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/v_XDNTD2w4I)

When a **bunker**(沙坑/地堡) **buster**(破坏者/小鬼) bomb is dropped from a plane, it penetrates deep into the ground and can reach an underground bunker before exploding.  

当一种钻地炸弹从飞机上投下时，它会深入地底，甚至到达地下掩体后才爆炸。  

These bombs are designed with a delayed fuse that is activated when it's dropped.  

这些炸弹设计有延时引信，投下时会启动。  

And once they reach the ground, their speed and hardened steel **casing**(套/盒) allow them to burrow deep.  

当它们到达地面时，其高速和坚硬的钢制外壳使其能够深钻入地底。  

The delayed fuse ensures that it detonates after reaching the bunker.  

延时引信确保其在到达掩体后才会爆炸。  

### [Why Doesn't Stomach Acid Eat Your Stomach?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/02bWvojZU_A)

If you took your stomach acid, poured it into a cup, and then dropped one of your teeth inside, the acid would immediately begin breaking them down.  

如果你把胃酸倒进一个杯子里，然后把一颗牙齿放进去，胃酸会立即开始分解牙齿。  

The tooth's enamel would start to dissolve, and depending on the material, the cup itself would begin to deteriorate.  

牙齿的牙釉质会开始溶解，而杯子本身也可能会因材质不同而开始腐蚀。  

So if stomach acid is this strong, why doesn't it eat through the walls of your stomach?  

如果胃酸如此强大，为什么不会腐蚀胃壁呢？  

Well, it's because they're coated in a thick layer of mucus.  

这是因为胃壁覆盖着一层厚厚的粘液。  

This mucus protects the stomach lining by creating a barrier that shields against the stomach acid.  

这种粘液通过形成屏障来保护胃壁免受胃酸的侵蚀。  

Without the mucus, your stomach would literally eat itself.  

如果没有这层粘液，你的胃会直接消化自己。  

### [What Happens in Your Brain Right Before You Die?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ZPGdcnzdzgc)

Right before you die, your brain has a surge of activity causing a type of electrical wave.  

在你死亡前，大脑会出现一波活动高峰，产生一种电波。  

These waves activate parts of the brain associated with memory and consciousness.  

这些电波会激活与记忆和意识相关的大脑区域。  

And this can continue for up to 2 minutes after death.  

这种现象可以持续到死亡后两分钟。  

Now, since there isn't a biological reason for this to happen, some researchers believe that the brain is pre-planned to do this, giving you a chance to recall memories one last time.  

由于这种现象没有生物学上的原因，一些研究人员认为大脑是预先计划好这样做的，让你有机会最后回忆一次记忆。

### [Can Your Tongue Print Be Used as Evidence?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b2-kf9JkLtg)

Imagine you were robbing a grocery store but got distracted by a huge lollipop.  

想象一下你正在抢劫一家杂货店，却被一个巨大的棒棒糖分散了注意力。  

You thought it was real until you gave it a lick and realized it was fake.  

你以为它是真的，舔了一下才发现它是假的。  

**Little did you know** your tongue print might have left behind a clue for police.  

你可能不知道，你的舌纹可能为警方留下了线索。  

You see, just like fingerprints, your tongue has distinct patterns and textures.  

你看，就像指纹一样，你的舌头也有独特的纹理和质地。  

And in theory, forensic scientists could actually use these tongue prints to find suspects in **criminal investigations**(刑事调查).  

从理论上讲，法医科学家可以通过这些舌纹找到刑事案件中的嫌疑人。  

### [What Happens If You Bend the Barrel of a Gun?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/e3uRN-xccYE)

If you bend the barrel of a gun and then shot a bullet, most people think it would just cause the gun to explode.  

如果你把枪管弯曲后开枪，大多数人认为枪会直接爆炸。  

But that's not actually what would happen.  

但事实并非如此。  

You see, if you bend the barrel 90°, the curve would slow the bullet down, but it would probably still exit the gun.  

如果把枪管弯曲90度，这种弯曲会减缓子弹速度，但它可能仍会从枪管中射出。  

Now if you bent it all the way back where it was pointing at you, this bend would cause the bullet to get stuck.  

如果把枪管完全弯回指向自己，这种弯曲会让子弹卡住。  

And the combustion would create a lot of pressure with nowhere to go, potentially causing the gun to explode.  

燃烧产生的压力无处释放，这可能导致枪爆炸。  

### [Does Water Stop Bullets?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pqt4gL1Ixzs)

If you shoot a gun into a body of water, some people think it will completely stop the bullet.  

如果你向水中开枪，有些人认为水会完全阻止子弹。  

But is that actually true?  

但事实真的是这样吗？  

Well, water is much more dense than air, and this can make the bullet rapidly lose speed and energy, usually stopping within just a few feet.  

水的密度比空气大得多，这会让子弹迅速失去速度和能量，通常会在几英尺内停止。  

But if you threw in a grenade, this change in density has less of an effect, and it will still cause a powerful underwater explosion, creating dangerous shock waves.  

但如果你扔下一颗手榴弹，这种密度的变化影响较小，仍会引发强大的水下爆炸，产生危险的冲击波。  

### [How Do Circus Cannons Work?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6RlyqrM7KR8)

How do circus cannons not hurt the performer as they shoot out?  

为什么马戏团大炮不会伤害被射出的表演者？  

Well, you might think the cannon is just extra cushioned inside, adding protection.  

你可能认为大炮内部有额外的缓冲材料，用于保护表演者。  

But the answer lies within the actual mechanics of the projectile.  

但答案在于炮弹的实际机械原理。  

You see, this cannon doesn't actually use gunpowder or explosives.  

实际上，这种大炮并不使用火药或爆炸物。  

Instead, it utilizes a compressed air system that quickly drives up the platform holding the performer, causing them no harm.  

它使用的是压缩空气系统，快速推动托住表演者的平台，不会对他们造成伤害。 、、

### [What Is a Bean Bag Round?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vXdez2NSg5o)

A bean bag round is just like a normal **shotgun**(霰弹枪) **shell**(<美>子弹), except instead of **pellets**(小球), it's packed with a small bean bag.  

豆袋子弹和普通霰弹枪子弹很相似，但里面装的不是弹丸，而是一个小豆袋。  

These small fabric pillows are filled with tiny balls of lead, and they're designed to **incapacitate**(使无能力) rather than penetrate.  

这些小布袋里装满了铅球，设计目的是制服目标而不是穿透。  

They're used when law enforcement needs a non-lethal option.  

它们通常在执法中需要非致命手段时使用。  

Although impact can be significant, almost like getting struck by a fast ball.  

虽然冲击力很大，几乎像被快速投出的棒球击中一样。

### [Why Do Worms Come Out When You Rub Sticks?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vuv9vkWTBy0)

If you shove a stick in the ground and rub it with another stick, there's a good chance that worms will start to crawl to the surface in droves.  

如果你把一根棍子插进地里，然后用另一根棍子摩擦，就很可能会有大量的蚯蚓爬到地面上来。  

This is because the vibrations mimic the sensation of rain.  

这是因为这些振动模仿了下雨的感觉。  

And worms like the rain because it allows them to move around better on the surface without drying out.  

而蚯蚓喜欢雨水，因为雨水可以让它们在地面上更自由地活动而不会干燥。  

So when they sense these vibrations, they think it's rain falling on the ground, which causes them to come out and get caught.  

所以当它们感受到这些振动时，会误以为是雨水落在地上，从而爬出来并被捕捉。  

### [How Do Octopuses Regrow Limbs?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BiWhAT_Z-bw)

If an octopus loses some of its limbs and then somehow makes it back into the ocean, you might think it would die from the open wounds.  

如果章鱼失去了一些触肢，然后设法回到海里，你可能会认为它会因伤口敞开而死亡。  

But they have an ability that allows them to quickly seal the cut before it becomes infected.  

但它们有一种能力，可以快速封闭伤口，防止感染。  

Once the wounds begin to heal, new cells can start to reconstruct the missing limbs.  

当伤口开始愈合后，新细胞会开始重建缺失的触肢。  

And after several weeks, new fully functional tentacles regrow.  

几周后，新的触肢会完全再生并恢复功能。  

### [How to Save Someone From Choking?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/phl3cShCOxM)

If someone is choking, you can stand behind them, wrap your arms around their waist, and shove your fist upward just above their belly button.  

如果有人被噎住了，你可以站在他们身后，用双臂环绕他们的腰部，然后在他们肚脐上方向上用力推拳头。  

This sudden impact forcefully pushes air from the lungs up into the throat.  

这种突然的冲击会将肺部的空气强行推入喉咙。  

The pressure builds as air accumulates behind the food until it dislodges the blockage, which clears the airway.  

随着空气积聚在食物后方，压力增加，直到堵塞物被移除，从而清理气道。  

And while this maneuver can be life-saving, it can also break ribs and cause bruising.  

虽然这种动作可以救命，但也可能造成肋骨骨折和淤伤。  

### [Ancient Doctors' Strange Practices](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ilY3xqB-930)

Ancient doctors were known to taste **earwax**(耳蜡), drink another person's urine, and would even smell their poop.  

古代医生据说会品尝耳屎、喝别人的尿，甚至闻他们的粪便。  

And while this sounds disgusting today, it was actually a pretty common practice back then.  

虽然今天听起来令人恶心，但在当时这其实是很常见的做法。  

You see, these doctors believed that they could determine if someone was healthy by the way these substances smelled and tasted.  

这些医生认为，通过这些物质的气味和味道可以判断一个人是否健康。  

And since they didn't have any equipment, they just examined the fluids themselves.  

因为当时没有任何设备，他们只能自己检查这些体液。  

### [What If You Could Drive to Space?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/70usAsXiZf8)

If it were possible to drive to the Moon in a car, it would take just about 5 months at highway speeds.  

如果你能开车到月球，以高速公路的速度，大约需要5个月。  

And from the Moon, if you wanted to reach the closest planet, Mercury, the drive would last about 88 years.  

从月球出发，如果你想抵达最近的行星——水星，这段旅程将持续约88年。  

From here, if you wanted to reach the edge of the Milky Way, the trip would last just over 500 billion years.  

如果从这里出发前往银河系的边缘，旅程将持续超过5000亿年。

### [Why Did the Titanic Sink?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OKr5jSXbPPs)

When the Titanic hit the iceberg, it tore several holes in the ship's side, causing water to flood in.  

当泰坦尼克号撞上冰山时，它在船体侧面撕开了几个洞，导致水涌入。  

Now, the ship was designed with these compartments that could contain flooding if the hole got damaged.  

这艘船设计了许多隔舱，如果船体受损，这些隔舱可以控制进水。  

And if up to four of these compartments became compromised, the ship would still be able to float.  

如果最多只有四个隔舱被破坏，船仍然可以浮在水面上。  

But the iceberg ripped into six of them near the bow of the ship, and they began to rapidly flood.  

但冰山撕裂了船首附近的六个隔舱，这些隔舱迅速被淹没。  

This made the bow sink into the water, causing the back half to lift into the air.  

这使得船首沉入水中，导致船尾抬高到空中。  

Eventually, the middle section couldn't support the weight and broke in half, and both sides sank to the ocean floor.  

最终，中间部分无法承受重量而断裂，两部分都沉入了海底。  

### [Why Is There Gold in Some People's Poop?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yGW1-5U9GfM)

Some people have actual gold in their poop, and the reason for this is pretty dumb.  

有些人的粪便里真的有黄金，而原因其实很荒唐。  

You see, there's this pill that contains non-toxic edible gold flakes that pass through your digestive system.  

你看，有一种药丸含有无毒的可食用金箔，会通过你的消化系统。  

And as your body processes your food in your intestines, it's not actually able to break down this gold.  

当你的身体在肠道中处理食物时，其实无法分解这些金箔。  

Instead, the flakes mix with waste and come out intact in your poop.  

相反，这些金箔会与废物混合，完整地排出体外。  

The pill costs $425, if you were wondering.  

顺便说一句，这种药丸的价格是425美元。  

### [The Pilot Who Got Sucked Out of a Plane—and Survived](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pMCOyPPiA5Y)

In 1990, a pilot got sucked out of a cockpit midair, with only his legs preventing him from being fully ejected.  

1990年，一名飞行员在空中被吸出驾驶舱，仅靠双腿阻止了他完全被抛出。  

The plane's windshield had suddenly broken off, causing the cabin to become rapidly depressurized.  

飞机的挡风玻璃突然脱落，令机舱迅速失压。  

A flight attendant managed to grab the pilot's legs and held on as the co-pilot attempted to stabilize the plane.  

一名乘务员设法抓住了飞行员的双腿，同时副驾驶努力稳定飞机。  

His head was repeatedly striking the fuselage, and the crew thought he was dead.  

他的头部不断撞击机身，机组人员认为他已经死亡。  

But they kept holding on so his body wouldn't fly off and damage an engine or wing.  

但他们仍然紧紧抓住他，以免他的尸体飞出并损坏发动机或机翼。  

After about 20 minutes, the plane landed, and miraculously, the pilot ended up surviving.  

大约20分钟后，飞机着陆，奇迹般地，这名飞行员最终幸存下来。  

### [What to Do If Your Parachute Fails?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YuTHHKljbgs)

If your parachute fails to deploy while you're skydiving, first check for any tangles or obstructions in the lines.  

如果在跳伞时降落伞未能打开，首先检查绳索是否有缠结或阻碍。  

If that doesn't work, pull the reserve parachute handle immediately.  

如果没有效果，立即拉备用伞的拉柄。  

If the reserve chute also fails, try to spread your body to increase air resistance and aim for a safe landing spot, like a soft field.  

如果备用伞也失效，试着张开身体以增加空气阻力，并瞄准一个安全的着陆点，例如柔软的地面。  

Brace for impact by slightly bending your knees and preparing to roll to absorb.  

着陆时稍微弯曲膝盖，并准备翻滚以缓冲冲击力。  

### [How Corsets Deformed Women's Bodies](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8tTSqwrx6bs)

**Corsets**(束身内衣) used to be squeezed so tight back in the 19th century that some women actually had their internal organs shifted around.  

在19世纪，紧身胸衣被勒得很紧，以至于一些女性的内脏真的发生了移位。  

And this would sometimes cause them severe digestive issues.  

这有时会导致她们出现严重的消化问题。  

Some women also experienced breathing problems and would faint frequently.  

有些女性还会出现呼吸问题，并经常晕倒。  

Wearing a tight corset from a young age often caused **deformities**(畸形) in the **rib cage**(胸廓), making them narrow and compressed as they aged.  

从小就穿戴紧身胸衣通常会导致胸腔变形，随着年龄增长变得狭窄和压缩。

### [The Dangers of Traps in Warfare ⚔️](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kAW-bU01R3I)

The soldier's foot would break through a hidden bamboo **slat**(板条) and into a hole if they stepped onto a cartridge trap.

士兵的脚会踩破一个隐藏的竹条，掉进一个洞里，如果他们踩上了弹药陷阱。

Inside, a bullet was positioned on top of a nail that was fastened to a wooden board.

里面，一颗子弹放置在一个固定在木板上的钉子上方。

When the soldier's foot hit this shell, it pushed the nail into the primer.

当士兵的脚踩到这个弹壳时，它会将钉子推入底火。

This caused the shell to suddenly explode and shoot back up at the soldier.

这导致弹壳突然爆炸，向士兵射去。

### [How to Survive Falling Through Ice ❄️](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ppw2GE3fLpQ)

If the ice starts to crack, you should immediately spread out your arms before you start falling.

如果冰开始破裂，你应该立刻张开双臂，然后再开始下落。

This will allow you to grab onto the ice and prevents you from being fully submerged.

这样可以让你抓住冰面，防止你完全淹没。

But if you do fall in, you might become confused and lose track of which way is up.

但如果你掉进冰水里，你可能会感到混乱，失去方向感。

In this panic state, you could end up swimming away from the opening, trapping yourself under the ice.

在这种恐慌状态下，你可能会游离开洞口，导致自己被困在冰下。

If this happens, stay calm and look for light.

如果发生这种情况，保持冷静，寻找光线。

This is usually where the hole is.

This would happen in big cities in the 18th century when graveyards were overcrowded and couldn't expand.

这种情况发生在18世纪的大城市，当时墓地过于拥挤，无法扩展。

In extreme cases, up to 12 coffins would be stacked on top of each other in the same grave.

在极端情况下，最多会有12个棺材在同一个墓穴上方堆叠。

Now the bodies on top weren't buried deep enough and would sometimes **poke through**(穿过/穿透) the ground.

现在，上面的尸体埋得不够深，有时会从地面冒出来。

### [Understanding Tornado Classifications 🌪️](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Av06qUAz958)

This is an F0 tornado and it could knock over your trash can and possibly damage some of your gutters.

If your brain gets damaged, you could wake up from a coma fully aware but completely unable to move or speak.

如果你的大脑受损，你可能会从昏迷中醒来，完全清醒，但完全无法运动或说话。

This happens when your **brain stem**(脑干), which controls motor functions, becomes damaged.

这种情况发生在控制运动功能的脑干受损时。

The brain can't send signals to the muscles throughout your body, leaving only eye movement and blinking for communication.

大脑无法向全身的肌肉发送信号，只留下眼睛的运动和眨眼作为交流方式。

But you'd still be able to think, meaning you'd essentially be trapped within your brain.

但你仍然可以思考，这意味着你基本上被困在自己的大脑里。

### [How a Flamethrower Works 🔥](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RsMj3mVq2nc)

When you pull the trigger on a flamethrower, it opens a valve near the bottom allowing fuel to be pumped from a **pressurized**(加压的) tank.

当你拉动火焰喷射器的扳机时，它会打开底部的一个阀门，从加压罐中泵送燃料。

The fuel travels through a hose towards the nozzle and is forced out the end at a high pressure.

燃料通过一根软管流向喷嘴，并以高压喷出。

**At which point**(就在这时) a small flame ignites the fuel as it comes out, which produces a continuous stream of fire.

此时，一小束火焰点燃喷出的燃料，产生连续的火焰。

### [The Terrifying Possibility of Being Buried Alive ⚰️](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/w7PGmnhNUMY)

Imagine waking up in a coffin and realizing that you were mistakenly buried alive.

想象一下，你在棺材中醒来，意识到自己被错误地活埋了。

Now this wouldn't happen with the medical guidelines we have today, but in the 19th century, old coffins were found with scratch marks on the inside.

这种情况在今天的医学指南下不会发生，但在19世纪，旧棺材的内部发现了抓痕。

Making this a **legitimate**(合理的/合法的) concern.

这使得这一问题成为一个合理的担忧。

So as a solution, they started adding strings inside the coffins that traveled up to the ground and were connected to a little bell.

因此，作为解决方案，他们开始在棺材内部添加绳索，这些绳索延伸到地面，并连接到一个小铃铛。

If you woke up underground in a coffin, you could just ring the bell signaling that you're still alive.

如果你在地下的棺材里醒来，你可以摇铃，表示你仍然活着。

### [The Thai Cave Rescue 🏞️](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gQJIHZP-F6c)

In 2018, a group of boys were exploring a cave in Thailand when suddenly the tunnels flooded with water and they became trapped.

2018年，一群男孩在泰国探索一个洞穴时，突然隧道被水淹没，他们被困住了。

They were over 2 miles deep, and the flooding caused the tight tunnels to be completely filled with water.

他们被困在超过2英里深的地方，洪水使狭窄的隧道完全被水填满。

After 10 days, rescuers finally found them, but they had an extremely difficult time navigating the tunnels.

经过10天，救援人员终于找到了他们，但在隧道中的导航非常困难。

Unfortunately, one even died during the operation.

不幸的是，其中一人在救援行动中遇难。

Because of this, they couldn't find a way to get the boys out safely.

因此，他们无法找到安全救出男孩的方法。

Their last option was to give them a sedative to knock them out, fit them with diving masks, and transport their unconscious bodies through the tunnels one by one.

他们最后的选择是给他们镇静剂，让他们失去意识，给他们戴上潜水面具，一一将他们的昏迷身体通过隧道运送。

All 12 boys and their coach were safely rescued after 18 days underground.

所有12名男孩和他们的教练在地下被困18天后安全获救。

### [Pressure Release Mines and Their Myths 💣](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AXbYnBJN1x0)

If you step on a pressure release mine, theoretically, it would trigger a spring mechanism inside that pulls back a firing pin.

如果你踩到一个压力释放地雷，理论上，它会触发内部的弹簧机制，拉回击针。

Now if you stay completely still and don't step off, supposedly the firing pin won't move.

现在，如果你保持完全静止并不踩上去，击针理论上不会移动。

But if you remove any weight, the firing pin hits a detonator causing an explosion.

但如果你去掉任何重量，击针会撞击引爆器，引发爆炸。

Now this idea was **popularized**(普及/使流行) by wartime propaganda and movies at the time.

这个想法在战争时期的宣传和电影中被广泛传播。

In reality, these mines don't actually operate like this; most of them detonate as soon as any pressure is applied.

实际上，这些地雷并不是这样操作的；大多数在施加任何压力时就会引爆。

### [The Effects of Snake Venom 🐍](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GdWACAchclU)

When a snake bites you, the muscles around their venom glands tighten and this squeezes venom through the fangs and into your body.

当蛇咬你时，它们的毒腺周围的肌肉收缩，挤压毒素通过毒牙注入你的体内。

It immediately starts to break down tissues, causing pain and swelling.

它立即开始破坏组织，导致疼痛和肿胀。

But some snakes have venom that targets nerves and blocks communication, which can result in paralysis.

但一些蛇的毒液针对神经并阻碍信号传递，这可能导致瘫痪。

If the venom reaches the muscle around your lungs, it can be fatal.

如果毒液到达你肺部周围的肌肉，可能会致命。

### [Hysterical Strength Explained 💪](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ShRYxQcVQwU)

In 1964, a woman lifted up a car that had fallen on her son all by herself. This is called hysterical strength and it happens when the body releases large amounts of adrenaline in response to extreme stress.

1964年，一位女性独自抬起了一辆压在她儿子身上的车。这被称为“歇斯底里的力量”，当身体在极端压力下释放大量肾上腺素时，就会发生这种情况。

This rapidly increases blood flow to your muscles, giving them more oxygen and energy, and it allows for brief moments of incredible strength that are usually impossible under normal conditions.

这会迅速增加肌肉的血流量，为它们提供更多的氧气和能量，并允许在通常情况下不可能的短暂时刻展现出惊人的力量。

### [The Dangers of Falling Icicles ❄️](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KH7xDQaFgCE)

Falling **icicles**(冰柱) have been known to **impale**(刺穿) people underneath them, and this happens because of the way icicles form sharply as water drips and refreezes.

落下的冰柱已知会刺穿它们下方的人，这发生在冰柱形成时水滴快速冻结的方式。

Since the tip is narrow, it cools and freezes rapidly, maintaining its pointed shape.

由于尖端狭窄，它迅速降温和冻结，保持其尖锐的形状。

And if the point is sharp enough and the icicle is heavy, they could cause severe injury or worse.

如果尖端足够锋利，且冰柱足够重，可能会造成严重伤害甚至更糟的后果。

### [The Effects of Titanic Depth on Your Body 🌊](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OZygnVXyo3o)

If you were pulled down to the depth of the Titanic, most people think that your eyeballs would pop out of your head and burst from the pressure.

如果你被拖到泰坦尼克号的深度，大多数人认为你的眼球会因压力而从头部弹出。

But your eyes are actually made up of mostly water, and water is incompressible, meaning they wouldn't burst.

但你的眼睛主要由水构成，而水是不可压缩的，这意味着它们不会爆裂。

But any part of your body that is filled with air, like your chest and sinuses, would be crushed, causing severe damage and deformity.

但你身体中任何充满空气的部分，如胸部和鼻窦，都会被压碎，造成严重损伤和变形。

### [Ancient Head Drilling for Headaches 🧠](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OJqArhMPQT4)

A doctor would drill a hole in your head if you had a really bad headache 500 years ago. They would begin by shaving the area, then use a hand-operated tool to start drilling into your skull.

如果你500年前有严重头痛，医生会在你头上钻一个孔。他们会先剃掉该区域的毛发，然后用手动工具开始钻入你的颅骨。

Some of these doctors believed this would allow **evil spirits**(恶灵) to escape through the hole.

一些医生相信这可以让恶灵通过孔逃出。

In reality, the procedure had a very low success rate and probably just caused more pain.

实际上，这个手术的成功率非常低，可能只会造成更多的痛苦。

### [Mummification in Ancient Egypt 🏺](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IH17jG7WJWA)

如果你在古埃及去世，祭司会取出你所有的内脏。他们会留下你的心脏，因为他们相信那对来世至关重要。

But they'd store the other organs in jars. Then your body would be covered in salt for 40 days, which sucked out all of the moisture and prevented you from decaying.

但他们会将其他内脏储存于罐中。然后你的身体会被盐覆盖40天，以吸走所有水分，防止腐烂。

Afterwards, your body would be wrapped in layers of linen and sealed in resin, making you a mummy.

然后，你的身体会被层层亚麻布包裹，并封存在树脂中，成为木乃伊。

### [Vietnam War Traps ⚔️](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hDMTLtpEYQ4)

It would be connected to a trip wire placed near the ground, and once the soldier accidentally walked into it, the wire would pull the pin on the grenade attached to one of the ends.

它会连接到放在地面附近的绊线，一旦士兵意外走进，绊线就会拉动连接在一端的手榴弹的引信。

A similar trap had a spear attached to the end of a trip wire designed to pierce through the chest once activated.

另一个类似的陷阱是将矛固定在绊线上，设计成一旦激活就刺穿胸部。

如果你拔出一根头发，它可以承受大约40个便士而不断裂。但如果你将一半的头发编成一根绳子，结合的力量可以支撑一辆大型SUV。

If you add in all of your hair into the rope, it could withstand about 15 metric tons, which is about the weight of a young gray whale.

如果你把所有头发都编入绳子，它可以承受大约15公吨的重量，约等于一头年轻灰鲸的重量。

### [Phantom Limb Sensation 🦵](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LudaG3X75Ns)

如果你的腿被切掉，你可能仍然会有抓挠瘙痒的冲动，即使那里什么都没有。这种感觉被称为幻肢现象，一些人甚至会在他们不存在的肢体上感到剧烈疼痛。

Unfortunately, most amputees experience this strange phenomenon, and with no limb to itch or treat, these amputees are left with no good way to remedy the situation.

不幸的是，大多数截肢者都会经历这种奇怪的现象，而没有肢体可抓挠或治疗，这些截肢者没有好的方法来缓解这种情况。

### [Lung Surface Area Fact 🫁](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p1Bs8GhCjxQ)

如果你取出两个肺并以某种方式展开所有细小的气囊，大多数人会说它可以覆盖整个网球场。

Now this fun fact has been around forever, but the average size of the surface area of both of your lungs is only about 1,000 square feet.

这个有趣的事实已经存在很久了，但你两个肺的平均表面积只有大约1000平方英尺。

The size of a single tennis court is around 2,100 square feet, meaning your lungs would only cover about half of the court.

单个网球场的面积大约为2100平方英尺，这意味着你的肺只会覆盖场地的一半。

### [The Strength of Human Bones 🦴](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ttpaCc22iWc)

If you took out one of your bones and somehow **molded**(塑造/使发霉) it into a chunk about this big, you might think it would be completely crushed under the weight of a car.

如果你取出一根骨头并以某种方式将其塑造成这么大一块，你可能会认为它会在汽车的重量下完全粉碎。

But human bones are actually made of a tough mix of minerals and a stretchy protein called **collagen**(胶原), and this makes them so strong that a single cubic inch can support the weight of nearly five standard cars.

但人类的骨头实际上是由一种坚固的矿物质和一种称为胶原蛋白的弹性蛋白混合而成，这使得它们非常坚固，单立方英寸的骨头可以支撑近五辆标准汽车的重量。

### [Escaping a Sinking Car 🚗💦](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ngFnSJd8B1g)

If you're in a car that's sinking, most people would try to open the door to escape, but this is nearly impossible because of the pressure of the water.

如果你在一辆正在下沉的汽车里，大多数人会试图打开车门逃生，但这几乎是不可能的，因为水的压力。

Instead, you should focus on the windows. If they're electric, try to lower them quickly before the system fails.

相反，你应该专注于窗户。如果是电动窗户，尽量在系统失灵之前迅速降下它们。

If the windows don't open, use a sharp object to break the glass, targeting the center.

如果窗户打不开，用锋利的物体打破玻璃，瞄准中心。

And if all else fails, wait until the car is fully submerged. By this time, the pressure should have equalized, allowing the door to open more easily.

如果其他办法都不奏效，等到汽车完全沉没。到那时，压力应该已经平衡，使得车门更容易打开。

### [Army Ants as First Aid 🐜](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KXqjIF9PNV0)

The Army ant is placed on the wound and positioned so its jaws clamp tightly on the edges, securing them together.

军队蚂蚁被放在伤口上，并被定位，使其下颚紧紧夹住伤口边缘，将它们固定在一起。

Then the ant's body is twisted off, leaving its head and mandibles in place, which acts as a stitch.

然后蚂蚁的身体被扭掉，只留下它的头和下颚，这就起到了缝合的作用。

More are added depending on the size of the wound, and these ant stitches are left in the skin until the edges of the wound stay closed **on their own**(独立自主地).

根据伤口的大小，可能会加入更多蚂蚁，这些蚂蚁缝合会留在皮肤里，直到伤口的边缘自行闭合。

### [Sperm Journey to Fertilization 🐣](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iM39Cp0oXsM)

As millions of sperm flood the **reproductive**(生殖的) tract, only a few hundred of them will even reach the area where the **egg**(卵子) is, and typically only one will actually make contact.

当数百万个精子涌入生殖道时，只有几百个能够到达卵子所在的区域，通常只有一个会真正接触到卵子。

After it penetrates, their genetic materials merge, forming a new cell called a **zygote**(受精卵). 

一旦它成功穿透，精子的遗传物质会合并，形成一个称为合子的新的细胞。

The zygote divides multiple times as it travels down the **fallopian**(输卵管) tube towards the **uterus**(子宫). 

合子在向子宫移动的过程中会多次分裂。

Now a multicellular **embryo**(胚胎) implants itself in the **lining**(膜/内衬) of the uterus and begins to develop into a baby.

### [Toxoplasma and Mice Behavior 🐭](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LlVGLSmSboU)

If a mouse eats food that's contaminated with **Toxoplasma**(/ˌtɒksəˈplæzmə/), it loses its instinctive fear of cats. 

如果一只老鼠吃了被弓形虫污染的食物，它会失去对猫的本能恐惧。

This dangerous shift in behavior is not an accident, but a manipulation by this parasite. 

这种危险的行为变化并非偶然，而是这种寄生虫的操控。

You see, Toxoplasma needs to get into a cat in order to reproduce, so it causes the infected mouse to become unusually attracted to the scent of cat urine. 

你看，弓形虫需要进入猫体内才能繁殖，因此它使受感染的老鼠对猫尿的气味产生异常的吸引力。

Bringing it closer to cats and essentially causing it to sacrifice itself. 

这使老鼠更接近猫，从而基本上导致它自我牺牲。

This sinister survival strategy ensures that Toxoplasma completes its life cycle in the cat. 

这种阴险的生存策略确保了弓形虫在猫体内完成其生命周期。
