if you break a finger it can be gently

moved back to its normal position then a

piece of metal is placed along the

bottom to support it this splint is

wrapped with straps to hold it firmly in

place preventing you from accidentally

moving it and causing more harm and this

allows the bones and tissue to have time

to fix themselves Weeks Later the splint

comes off and hopefully you can start

moving it again
