if you spend your entire life pooping

into a massive cauldron then wait it

after a lifetime of relieving yourself

how heavy would it be the answer

actually depends on if you're a man or a

woman because women live several years

older on average for men with a 76-year

life expectancy the answer is over

£24,000 or £1,000 kg but for women with

an 81-year life expectancy it increases

to almost 26,000 lb or nearly 12,000 kg
