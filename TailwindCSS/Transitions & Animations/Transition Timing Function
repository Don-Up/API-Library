### Transition Timing Function in TailwindCSS

**Transition Timing Function**: TailwindCSS provides utilities to control the **timing function** of transitions, which defines the speed curve of the transition effect. This determines how the transition progresses over time, creating different easing effects.

#### Common Transition Timing Function Classes:
- **`ease-linear`**: Transitions at a constant speed.
- **`ease-in`**: Starts slowly, then speeds up.
- **`ease-out`**: Starts quickly, then slows down.
- **`ease-in-out`**: Starts slowly, speeds up, then slows down.

> **过渡时间函数**：TailwindCSS 提供了控制 **过渡时间函数** 的工具类，定义过渡效果的速度曲线，影响动画的加速或减速方式。

#### React Example with JSX Comments:

```jsx
{/* Ease-in-out timing function */}
<div className="transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out transform hover:scale-110 p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white">
  Hover to scale with ease-in-out
</div>

{/* Linear timing function */}
<div className="transition-all duration-500 ease-linear transform hover:scale-110 p-4 bg-green-500 text-white">
  Hover to scale with linear timing
</div>
```

In this React example:
- **`ease-in-out`** creates a smooth acceleration and deceleration during the scaling effect.
- **`ease-linear`** applies a constant speed throughout the transition.
