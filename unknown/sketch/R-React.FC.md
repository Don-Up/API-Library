#### Definition
`React.FC` (or `React.FunctionComponent`) is a type definition in TypeScript for functional components in React.

#### Type-Checking
It provides type-checking for component props, ensuring adherence to the functional component structure.

#### TypeScript Benefits
By using `React.FC`, developers can leverage TypeScript’s advantages, such as auto-completion and type inference, enhancing code robustness and maintainability.

#### Children Props
It includes built-in support for `children` props, simplifying their usage within components.

#### Developer Preferences
Some developers prefer using regular function declarations or arrow functions without `React.FC` to avoid limitations like issues with default props and generics.
