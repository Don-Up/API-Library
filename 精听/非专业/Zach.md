> 当有人被卡住时，将解噎器紧紧地放在嘴和鼻子上，形成密封。  

Then you pull the **plunger**(活塞), which pulls the air into the **chamber**(指dechoker的腔体), creating a strong vacuum inside.  

> 然后拉动活塞，将空气吸入腔体内，形成一个强大的真空。  

This vacuum pulls air from the person's throat, generating enough pressure to dislodge the object.  

> 这个真空从人的喉咙中抽出空气，产生足够的压力将异物移开。

## [How Spring Gun Traps Work 😨](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K96XcV7z4FA)

If you step on this hidden wire, it pulls a **spring-loaded**(用弹簧顶住/承载的) mechanism connected to a gun's trigger.

As the spring pulls back, it causes the gun's **firing pin**(撞针) to strike the primer, which ignites the gunpowder inside the **cartridge**(弹壳).

> 当弹簧被拉回时，会触发枪击针撞击底火，从而点燃弹壳内的火药。

This explosion creates high-pressure gas, propelling the bullet out of the barrel.

> 这次爆炸会产生高压气体，将子弹从枪管中射出。
