## [India’s Massive Cobra Problem](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5GU-0gqMgkI)

In the late 1800s, India was under British rule, and they had a problem of the **slithery**(滑溜的) variety. The city of Delhi, one of the biggest in the British **Raj**(统治), was full of **cobras**(眼镜蛇) who kept killing people.

> 19世纪晚期，印度处于英国的统治之下，他们面临一个与蛇相关的问题。德里是英属印度最大的城市之一，那里到处都是眼镜蛇，这些蛇不断伤人致死。

The British didn’t want to get their own hands dirty, so they came up with a **bounty program**(赏金计划) for the Indians to **partake in**(参与). For every cobra they killed and brought to them, the crown would pay them money.

> 英国人不想亲自处理这些问题，于是他们推出了一项赏金计划，邀请印度人参与。每杀死一条眼镜蛇并将其带给英国当局，就能获得赏金。

This worked for a few years, and the streets were clear of cobras. But now cobra killing had become a very profitable business for bounty hunters.

> 这个计划在最初几年非常有效，街道上的眼镜蛇数量大幅减少。不过，捕杀眼镜蛇的赏金猎人却发现这变成了一项非常有利可图的生意。

So, people started to breed their own cobras, only to kill them later and give them to the crown for money.

> 于是，人们开始自己养殖眼镜蛇，然后再杀掉它们以换取赏金。

Once the British realized this was happening, they immediately ceased the program, which sent the **breeders**(饲养员) into a rage spiral.

> 当英国人意识到这种情况后，他们立刻终止了这个计划，这让养殖眼镜蛇的人愤怒不已。

Their cobras were now worthless, and they were very angry. So, they released all the cobras onto the streets, making the problem even worse than it was when they first started.

> 这些眼镜蛇变得一文不值，养殖者非常愤怒，于是将所有的眼镜蛇释放到街上，这使得问题比一开始还要严重。

From this, a new economics term was born: **perverse incentives**(反向激励), describing an incentive structure that leads to undesirable results.

> 由此产生了一个新的经济学术语：“反向激励”，用来描述一种导致不良结果的激励机制。

And this is still being studied in economics today.

> 这种现象至今仍然是经济学研究的一个课题。
