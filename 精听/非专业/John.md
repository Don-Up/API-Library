## [The slide that broke the internet 🤣](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9UeVGsWtRF8)

Throwback to about a year ago, a slide in Boston went viral, and you're probably wondering how a slide can go viral. 

> 大约一年前，波士顿的一座滑梯火了起来，你可能会好奇，一座滑梯怎么会走红呢？

Well, it’s because this video surfaced of a cop going down the slide, and as you can see, it was not a smooth ride at all. He went flying—just look at him!

> 原因是一段视频传开了，视频中一位警察滑下滑梯，正如你所看到的，这可不是一次顺滑的体验。他直接飞了出去——看看他吧！

When I first saw this video, I was wondering how the hell this happened. After doing a little bit of research, I saw this sign at the start of the slide that says it’s for ages 5 to 12.

> 当我第一次看到这段视频时，我就在想，这到底是怎么发生的？经过一番调查，我发现滑梯入口处有一个标志，上面写着“适合5到12岁的儿童”。

I’m assuming the cop probably saw it, but he just didn’t think it was going to be that urgent. Turns out, he was wrong.

> 我猜这位警察大概看到了这个标志，但他可能没觉得这会有什么问题。事实证明，他错了。

It’s especially funny when you watch this video of a kid going down the slide, and it’s the most peaceful thing ever—completely different from what the cop went through.

> 尤其有趣的是，当你看一个孩子滑下这座滑梯的视频时，整个过程非常平稳，完全不同于警察的经历。

Well, it’s because this video **surfaced**(显露/公开) of a cop going down the slide, and as you can see, it was not a smooth ride at all. He went flying—just look at him!
