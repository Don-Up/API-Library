### Static File Serving in Next.js

**Static File Serving**: Next.js allows you to serve static files, such as images, fonts, or other assets, from the **`public`** directory. Files in this directory are accessible via a URL path that matches the file's location in `public`. For example, a file located at `public/logo.png` can be accessed at `/logo.png`. These files are served statically, meaning they don't go through the Next.js server and are directly accessible.

#### Key Points:
- Place static assets in the **`public`** directory.
- Access files via `/filename.ext` URL.

> **静态文件服务**：Next.js 允许通过 `public` 目录提供静态文件，例如图像、字体等。该目录中的文件可通过与文件路径匹配的 URL 访问，如 `public/logo.png` 可通过 `/logo.png` 访问。

#### Example with Comments:

```jsx
// Accessing a static image from the public directory
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <img src="/logo.png" alt="Site Logo" /> {/* Points to public/logo.png */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:
- The image **`/logo.png`** is served statically from the **`public`** directory and directly referenced in the `<img>` tag.
