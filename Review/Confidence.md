# Confidence

The essence of the current problem is a lack of self-confidence. Condidence comes from two sources: One is English confidence, the other is technical confidence.

## English Confidence

The main thing about English is confidence in your listening skills. This is demonstrated by the following:

1. Ability to understand 90 percent of technical related texts in English. 
2. Ability to understand 100 percent of Zack D films shorts.

### Speaking

Currently there is a serious lack of time to practice speaking. There are several way to implement this: 

1. If you want to write something, you can write it in Chinese, then translated into English by DeepL. But there are a few important details to this practice. 
   1. First press play to hear the sentence read aloud again.
   2. Read it until you are fluent.
   3. Write down the sentence purely by memory.
   4. Compare your own writing with the original sentence.
2. For technical texts, there are two options.
   1. Listen to the text blind, until you can understand 90% of it.
   2. Listen to the original, then read along.
3. Read one sentence a day until you are close to the professional level.

With a lot of practice in these three ways, you can get good at speaking.
